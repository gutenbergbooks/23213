	<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND MOTHER GOOSE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">There</span> once lived in the woods an old rabbit
	gentleman named Uncle Wiggily Longears,
	and in the hollow-stump bungalow where he
	had his home there also lived Nurse Jane
	Fuzzy Wuzzy, a muskrat lady housekeeper.
	Near Uncle Wiggily there were, in hollow
	trees, or in nests or in burrows under the
	ground, many animal friends of his&#8212;rabbits,
	squirrels, puppy dogs, pussy cats, frogs,
	ducks, chickens and others, so that Uncle
	Wiggily and Nurse Jane were never lonesome.</p>

	<p>Often Sammie or Susie Littletail, a small
	boy and girl rabbit, would hop over to the
	hollow-stump bungalow, and call:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily! Can&#8217;t
	you come out and play with us?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the old rabbit gentleman, who was as
	fond of fun as a kitten, would put on his tall silk
	hat, take his red, white and blue striped barber-pole
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>rheumatism crutch, that Nurse Jane had
	gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk, and he
	would go out to play with the rabbit children,
	about whom I have told you in other books.</p>

	<p>Or perhaps Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the
	squirrel boys, might ask Uncle Wiggily to go
	after hickory nuts with them, or maybe Lulu,
	Alice or Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck children,
	would want their bunny uncle to see them
	go swimming.</p>

	<p>So, altogether, Uncle Wiggily had a good
	time in his hollow-stump bungalow which was
	built in the woods. When he had nothing else
	to do Mr. Longears would go for a ride in his
	airship. This was made of a clothes-basket, with
	toy circus balloons on it to make it rise up above
	the trees. Or Uncle Wiggily might take a trip
	in his automobile, which had big bologna sausages
	on the wheels for tires. And whenever the
	rabbit gentleman wanted the automobile wheels
	to go around faster he sprinkled pepper on the
	sausages.</p>

	<p>One day Uncle Wiggily said to Nurse Jane
	Fuzzy Wuzzy:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think I will go for a ride in my airship.
	Is there anything I can bring from the store
	for you?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>&#8220;Why, you might bring a loaf of bread and
	a pound of sugar,&#8221; answered the muskrat lady.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily, and
	then he took some soft cushions out to put in
	the clothes-basket part of his airship, so, in case
	the air popped out of the balloons, and he fell,
	he would land easy like, and soft.</p>

	<p>Soon the rabbit gentleman was sailing off
	through the air, over the tree tops, his paws in
	nice, warm red mittens that Nurse Jane had
	knitted for him. For it was winter, you see, and
	Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s paws would have been cold
	steering his airship, by the baby carriage wheel
	which guided it, had it not been for the mittens.</p>

	<p>It did not take the bunny uncle long to go to
	the store in his airship, and soon, with the loaf
	of bread and pound of sugar under the seat,
	away he started for his hollow-stump bungalow
	again.</p>

	<p>And, as he sailed on and over the tree tops,
	Uncle Wiggily looked far off, and he saw some
	black smoke rising in the air.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That smoke seems to be near my hollow-stump
	bungalow,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I
	guess Nurse Jane is starting a fire in the kitchen
	stove to get dinner. I must hurry home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily made his airship go faster, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>then he saw, coming toward him, a big bird,
	with large wings.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, that looks just like my old friend,
	Grandfather Goosey Gander,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily
	thought to himself. &#8220;I wonder why he is flying
	so high? He hardly ever goes up so near the
	clouds.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And he seems to have some one on his back,&#8221;
	spoke Uncle Wiggily out loud this time, sort of
	talking to the loaf of bread and the pound of
	sugar. &#8220;A lady, too,&#8221; went on the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;A lady with a tall hat on, something like mine,
	only hers comes to a point on top. And she has
	a broom with her. I wonder who it can be?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And when the big white bird came nearer to
	the airship Uncle Wiggily saw that it was not
	Grandfather Goosey Gander at all, but another
	big gander, almost like his friend, whom he
	often went to see. And then the bunny uncle
	saw who it was on the bird&#8217;s back.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Mother Goose!&#8221; cried Uncle
	Wiggily Longears. &#8220;It&#8217;s Mother Goose! She
	looks just like her pictures in the book, too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I am Mother Goose,&#8221; said the lady who
	was riding on the back of the big, white gander.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am glad to meet you, Mother Goose,&#8221;
	spoke Mr. Longears. &#8220;I have often heard
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>about you. I can see, over the tree tops, that
	Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, my muskrat lady
	housekeeper, is getting dinner ready. I can tell
	by the smoke. Will you not ride home with me?
	I will make my airship go slowly, so as not
	to get ahead of you and your fine gander-goose.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Alas, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; said Mother Goose,
	scratching her chin with the end of the broom
	handle, &#8220;I cannot come home to dinner with
	you much as I would like it. Alas! Alas!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the bunny uncle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because I have bad news for you,&#8221; said
	Mother Goose. &#8220;That smoke, which you saw
	over the tree tops, was not smoke from your
	chimney as Nurse Jane was getting dinner.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What was it then?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily,
	and a cold shiver sort of ran up and down between
	his ears, even if he did have warm, red
	mittens on his paws. &#8220;What was that smoke?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The smoke from your burning bungalow,&#8221;
	went on Mother Goose. &#8220;It caught fire, when
	Nurse Jane was getting dinner, and <span class="keep_together">now&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh! Don&#8217;t tell me Nurse Jane is burned!&#8221;
	cried Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I was not going to,&#8221; spoke Mother Goose,
	kindly. &#8220;But I must tell you that your hollow-stump
	bungalow is burned to the ground.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>There is nothing left but some ashes,&#8221; and she
	made the gander, on whose back she was riding,
	fly close alongside of Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s airship.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My nice bungalow burned!&#8221; exclaimed the
	rabbit gentleman. &#8220;Well, I am very, very sorry
	for that. But still it might be worse. Nurse
	Jane might have been hurt, and that would have
	been quite too bad. I dare say I can get another
	bungalow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is what I came to tell you about,&#8221; said
	Mother Goose. &#8220;I was riding past when I saw
	your Woodland hollow-stump house on fire, and
	I went down to see if I could help. It was too
	late to save the bungalow, but I said I would find
	a place for you and Nurse Jane to stay to-night,
	or as long as you like, until you can build a new
	home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is very kind of you,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;I hardly know what to do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have many friends,&#8221; went on Mother
	Goose. &#8220;You may have read about them in
	the book which tells of me. Any of my friends
	would be glad to have you come and live with
	them. There is the Old Woman Who Lives in
	a Shoe, for instance.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But hasn&#8217;t she so many children she doesn&#8217;t
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>know what to do?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily, as he
	remembered the story in the book.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mother Goose, &#8220;she has. I
	suppose you would not like it there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I like children,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;But if there are so many that the dear Old Lady
	doesn&#8217;t know what to do, she wouldn&#8217;t know
	what to do with Nurse Jane and me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you might go stay with my friend Old
	Mother Hubbard,&#8221; said Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But if I went there, would not the cupboard
	be bare?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;and what
	would Nurse Jane and I do for something to
	eat?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; spoke Mother Goose, as she
	reached up quite high and brushed a cobweb off
	the sky with her broom. &#8220;That will not do,
	either. I must see about getting Mother Hubbard
	and her dog something to eat. You can
	stay with her later. Oh, I have it!&#8221; suddenly
	cried the lady who was riding on the back of the
	white gander, &#8220;you can go stay with Old King
	Cole! He&#8217;s a jolly old soul!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily shook his head.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Mother Goose,&#8221; he
	said, slowly. &#8220;But Old King Cole might send
	for his fiddlers three, and I do not believe I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>would like to listen to jolly music to-day when
	my nice bungalow has just burned down.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, perhaps not,&#8221; agreed Mother Goose.
	&#8220;Well, if you can find no other place to stay to-night
	come with me. I have a big house, and
	with me live Little Bo Peep, Little Boy Blue,
	who is getting to be quite a big chap now, Little
	Tommie Tucker and Jack Sprat and his wife.
	Oh, I have many other friends living with me,
	and surely we can find room for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I
	will think about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he flew down in his airship to the place
	where the hollow-stump bungalow had been, but
	it was not there now. Mother Goose flew down
	with her gander after Uncle Wiggily. They
	saw a pile of blackened and smoking wood, and
	near it stood Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
	muskrat lady, and many other animals who lived
	in Woodland with Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so sorry!&#8221; cried Nurse Jane. &#8220;It
	is my fault. I was baking a pudding in the oven,
	Uncle Wiggily. I left it a minute while I ran
	over to the pen of Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck
	lady, to ask her about making a new kind of carrot
	sauce for the pudding, and when I came
	home the pudding had burned, and the bungalow
	was on fire.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily, kindly,
	&#8220;as long as you were not burned yourself, Nurse
	Jane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But where will you sleep to-night?&#8221; asked
	the muskrat lady, sorrowfully.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; began Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;I guess I
	<span class="keep_together">can&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come stay with us!&#8221; cried Sammie and
	Susie Littletail, the rabbit children.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Or with us!&#8221; invited Johnnie and Billie
	Bushytail, the squirrels.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And why not with us?&#8221; asked Nannie and
	Billie Wagtail, the goat children.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d ask you to come with us,&#8221; said Jollie
	and Jillie Longtail, the mouse children, &#8220;only
	our house is so small.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Many of Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s friends, who had
	hurried up to see the hollow-stump bungalow
	burn, while he was at the store, now, in turn, invited
	him to stay with them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I, myself, have asked him to come with me,&#8221;
	said Mother Goose, &#8220;or with any of my friends.
	We all would be glad to have him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;And this is what I will do, until I can
	build me a new bungalow. I will take turns
	staying at your different hollow-tree homes, your
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>nests or your burrows underground. And I will
	come and visit you also, Mother Goose, and all
	of your friends; at least such of them as have
	room for me.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll visit around
	now that my hollow-stump home is burned. I
	thank you all. Come, Nurse Jane, we will pay
	our first visit to Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
	rabbits.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And while the other animals hopped, skipped
	or flew away through the woods, and as Mother
	Goose sailed off on the back of her gander, to
	sweep more cobwebs out of the sky, Uncle Wiggily
	and Nurse Jane went to the Littletail burrow,
	or underground house.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; called Mother
	Goose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again, soon, sometime.
	And if ever you meet with any of my friends,
	Little Jack Horner, Bo Peep, or the three little
	pigs, about whom you may have read in my
	book, be kind to them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>And he did, as you may read in the next chapter,
	when, if the sugar spoon doesn&#8217;t tickle the
	carving knife and make it dance on the bread
	board, the story will be about Uncle Wiggily
	and the first little pig.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FIRST PIG</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old gentleman
	rabbit, came out of the underground
	burrow house of the Littletail family, where he
	was visiting a while with the bunny children,
	Sammie and Susie, because his own hollow-stump
	bungalow had burned down.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221;
	asked Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy, as he
	strapped his cabbage leaf books together, ready
	to go to school.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I am just going for a little walk,&#8221; answered
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, asked
	me to get her some court plaster from the five
	and six cent store, and on my way there I may
	have an adventure. Who knows?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are going to school,&#8221; said Susie. &#8220;Will
	you walk part of the way with us, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>&#8220;To be sure I will!&#8221; crowed the old gentleman
	rabbit, making believe he was Mr. Cock
	A. Doodle, the rooster.</p>

	<p>So Uncle Wiggily, with Sammie and Susie,
	started off across the snow-covered fields and
	through the woods. Pretty soon they came to
	the path the rabbit children must take to go to
	the hollow-stump school, where the lady mouse
	teacher would hear their carrot and turnip
	gnawing lessons.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good-by, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; called Sammie
	and Susie. &#8220;We hope you have a nice adventure,&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good-by. Thank you, I hope I do,&#8221; he answered.</p>

	<p>Then the rabbit gentleman walked on, while
	Sammie and Susie hurried to school, and pretty
	soon Mr. Longears heard a queer grunting noise
	behind some bushes near him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!&#8221; came the sound.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello! Who is there?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, if you please, I am here, and I am the
	first little pig,&#8221; came the answer, and out from
	behind the bush stepped a cute little piggie boy,
	with a bundle of straw under his paw.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So you are the first little pig, eh?&#8221; asked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;How many of you are there
	altogether?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Three, if you please,&#8221; grunted the first little
	pig. &#8220;I have two brothers, and they are the
	second and third little pigs. Don&#8217;t you remember
	reading about us in the Mother Goose
	book?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, of course I do!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily,
	twinkling his nose. &#8220;And so you are the first
	little pig. But what are you going to do with
	that bundle of straw?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to build me a house, Uncle Wiggily,
	of course,&#8221; grunted the piggie boy.
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what it says in the book?
	&#8216;Once upon a time there were three little pigs,
	named Grunter, Squeaker and Twisty-Tail.&#8217;
	Well, I&#8217;m Grunter, and I met a man with a load
	of straw, and I asked him for a bundle to make
	me a house. He very kindly gave it to me, and
	now, I&#8217;m off to build it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;May I come?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	help you put up your house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course you may come&#8212;glad to have
	you,&#8221; answered the first little pig. &#8220;Only you
	know what happens to me; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No! What?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;I guess I have forgotten the story.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>&#8220;Well, after I build my house of straw, just
	as it says in the Mother Goose story book, along
	comes a bad old wolf, and he blows it down,&#8221;
	said the first little pig.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, how dreadful!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily,
	&#8220;but maybe he won&#8217;t come to-day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will,&#8221; said the first little pig.
	&#8220;It&#8217;s that way in the book, and the wolf has to
	come.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, if he does,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	&#8220;maybe I can save you from him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you can!&#8221; grunted Grunter.
	&#8220;It is no fun to be chased by a wolf.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the rabbit gentleman and the piggie boy
	went on and on, until they came to the place
	where Grunter was to build his house of straw.
	Uncle Wiggily helped, and soon it was finished.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, it is real nice and cozy in here,&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily, when he had made a big pile
	of snow back of the straw house to keep off the
	north wind, and had gone in with the little piggie
	boy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, it is cozy enough,&#8221; spoke Grunter,
	&#8220;but wait until the bad wolf comes. Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe he won&#8217;t come,&#8221; said the rabbit,
	hopeful like.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>&#8220;Yes, he will!&#8221; cried Grunter. &#8220;Here he
	comes now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And, surely enough, looking out of the window,
	the piggie boy and Uncle Wiggily saw a
	bad wolf running over the snow toward them.
	The wolf knocked on the door of the straw
	house and cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No! No! By the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.
	I will not let you in!&#8221; answered Grunter,
	just like in the book.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll puff and I&#8217;ll blow, and I&#8217;ll blow
	your house in!&#8221; howled the wolf. Then he
	puffed and he blew, and, all of a sudden, over
	went the straw house. But, just as it was falling
	down, Uncle Wiggily cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Quick, Grunter, come with me! I&#8217;ll dig
	a hole for us in the pile of snow that I made back
	of your house and in there we&#8217;ll hide where the
	wolf can&#8217;t find us!&#8221; Then the rabbit gentleman,
	with his strong paws, just made for digging, burrowed
	a hole in the snow-bank, and as the straw
	house toppled down, into this hole he crawled
	with Grunter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got you!&#8221; cried the wolf, as he
	blew down the first little pig&#8217;s straw house. But
	when the wolf looked he couldn&#8217;t see Grunter
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>or Uncle Wiggily at all, because they were hiding
	in the snow-bank.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; howled the wolf. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
	like the book at all! Where is that little pig?&#8221;</p>

	<p>But the wolf could not find Grunter, and soon
	the bad creature went away, fearing to catch
	cold in his eyes. Then Uncle Wiggily and
	Grunter came out of the snow-bank and were
	safe, and Uncle Wiggily took Grunter home to
	the rabbit house to stay until Mother Goose
	came, some time afterward, to get the first little
	pig boy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221;
	said Mother Goose, &#8220;for being kind to one of
	my friends.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t mention it. I had a fine adventure,
	besides saving a little pig,&#8221; said the rabbit
	gentleman. &#8220;I wonder what will happen to
	me to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And we shall soon see for, if the snowball
	doesn&#8217;t wrap itself up in the parlor rug to hide
	away from the jam tart, when it comes home
	from the moving pictures, I&#8217;ll tell you next about
	Uncle Wiggily and the second little pig.</p>

<div id="chapter_3" class="chapter">

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SECOND PIG</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">There!</span> It&#8217;s all done!&#8221; exclaimed Nurse
	Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the nice muskrat lady
	housekeeper, who, with Uncle Wiggily Longears,
	the rabbit gentleman, was staying in the
	Littletail rabbit house, since the hollow-stump
	bungalow had burned down.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all done?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily,
	looking over the tops of his spectacles.</p>

	<p>&#8220;These jam tarts I baked for Billie and Nannie
	Wagtail, the goat children,&#8221; said Nurse Jane.
	&#8220;Will you take them with you when you go
	out for a walk, Uncle Wiggily, and leave them
	at the goat house?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I most certainly will,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman,
	very politely. &#8220;Is there anything else I can
	do for you, Nurse Jane?&#8221;</p>

	<p>But the muskrat lady wanted nothing more,
	and, wrapping up the jam tarts in a napkin so
	they would not catch cold, she gave them to Mr.
	Longears to take to the two goat children.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>Uncle Wiggily was walking along, wondering
	what sort of an adventure he would have that
	day, or whether he would meet Mother Goose
	again, when all at once he heard a voice speaking
	from behind some bushes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I will build my house here,&#8221; the
	voice said. &#8220;The wolf is sure to find me anyhow,
	and I might as well have it over with. I&#8217;ll
	make my house here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily looked over the bushes, and
	there he saw a funny little animal boy, with some
	pieces of wood on his shoulder.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, making his
	nose twinkle in a most jilly-jolly way. &#8220;Who
	are you, and what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I am Squeaker, the second little pig,
	and I am going to make a house of wood,&#8221; was
	the answer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember how it reads
	in the Mother Goose book? &#8216;Once upon a time
	there were three little pigs, named Grunter,
	Squeaker <span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember!&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said.
	&#8220;I met your brother Grunter yesterday, and
	helped him build his straw house.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="illo">
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>
		<img src="images/fig028.jpg" width="500" height="743" alt="A wolf knocks on a door, while a pig looks out of the window." />
		<p class="caption">&#8220;Little pig! Little pig!<br />
		Let me come in!&#8221;</p>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;That was kind of you,&#8221; spoke Squeaker. &#8220;I
	suppose the bad old wolf got him, though. Too
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>bad! Well, it can&#8217;t be helped, as it is that way
	in the book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily didn&#8217;t say anything about
	having saved Grunter, for he wanted to surprise
	Squeaker, so the rabbit gentleman just twinkled
	his nose again and asked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;May I have the pleasure of helping you
	build your house of wood?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed you may, thank you,&#8221; said Squeaker.
	&#8220;I suppose the old wolf will be along soon, so
	we had better hurry to get the house finished.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the second little pig and Uncle Wiggily
	built the wooden house. When it was almost
	finished Uncle Wiggily went out near the back
	door, and began piling up some cakes of ice to
	make a sort of box.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; asked Squeaker.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m just making a place where I can put
	these jam tarts I have for Nannie and Billie
	Wagtail,&#8221; the rabbit gentleman answered. &#8220;I
	don&#8217;t want the wolf to get them when he blows
	down your house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Squeaker. &#8220;I rather
	wish, now, he didn&#8217;t have to blow over my nice
	wooden house, and get me. But he has to, I
	s&#8217;pose, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s in the book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Still, Uncle Wiggily didn&#8217;t say anything, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>he just sort of blinked his eyes and twinkled his
	pink nose, until, all of a sudden, Squeaker looked
	across the snowy fields, and he cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here comes the bad old wolf now!&#8221;</p>

	<p>And, surely enough, along came the growling,
	howling creature. He ran up to the second
	little pig&#8217;s wooden house, and, rapping on the
	door with his paw, cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, no! By the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
	I will not let you in,&#8221; said the second little
	pig, bravely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll puff and I&#8217;ll blow, and I&#8217;ll puff
	and I&#8217;ll blow, and blow your house in!&#8221; howled
	the wolf.</p>

	<p>Then he puffed out his cheeks, and he took a
	long breath and he blew with all his might and
	main and suddenly:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Cracko!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Down went the wooden house of the second
	little piggie, and only that Uncle Wiggily and
	Squeaker jumped to one side they would have
	been squashed as flat as a pancake, or even two
	pancakes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; cried the rabbit gentleman in the
	piggie boy&#8217;s ear. &#8220;This way! Come with me!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked Squeaker, as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>he followed the rabbit gentleman over the
	cracked and broken boards, which were all that
	was left of the house.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are going to the little cabin that I made
	out of cakes of ice, behind your wooden house,&#8221;
	said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I put the jam tarts in it,
	but there is also room for us, and we can hide
	there until the bad wolf goes off.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, that isn&#8217;t the way it is in the book,&#8221; said
	the second little pig. <span class="keep_together">&#8220;But&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</span></p>

	<p>&#8220;No matter!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; So he and Squeaker hid in the ice
	cabin back of the blown-down house, and when
	the bad wolf came poking along among the
	broken boards, to get the little pig, he couldn&#8217;t
	find him. For Uncle Wiggily had closed the
	door of the ice place, and as it was partly covered
	with snow the wolf could not see through.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; howled the wolf. &#8220;That&#8217;s twice
	I&#8217;ve been fooled by those pigs! It isn&#8217;t like the
	book at all. I wonder where he can have
	gone?&#8221;</p>

	<p>But he could not find Squeaker or Uncle Wiggily
	either, and finally the wolf&#8217;s nose became so
	cold from sniffing the ice that he had to go home
	to warm it, and so Uncle Wiggily and Squeaker
	were safe.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know how to thank you,&#8221; said
	the second little piggie boy as the rabbit gentleman
	took him home to Mother Goose, after having
	left the jam tarts at the home of the Wagtail
	goats.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray do not mention it,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily,
	modest like, and shy. &#8220;It was just an adventure
	for me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He had another adventure the following day,
	Uncle Wiggily did. And if the dusting brush
	doesn&#8217;t go swimming in the soap dish, and get
	all lather so that it looks like a marshmallow
	cocoanut cake, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle
	Wiggily and the third little pig.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sounded a grunting, woofing

	<p>&#8220;Well, well! What is the matter with you

	took down from the sideboard his red, white and
	blue barber-pole striped rheumatism crutch that
	Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble, Grunter and Squeaker?&#8221;
	asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are lonesome for our brother,&#8221; said the
	two little piggie boys No. 1 and No. 2. &#8220;We
	want to see Twisty-Tail.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>For the first and second little pigs, after having
	been saved by Uncle Wiggily, and taken
	home to Mother Goose, had come back to pay a
	visit to the bunny gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps I may meet Twisty-Tail when
	I go walking to-day,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;If I do I&#8217;ll bring him home with me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, goodie!&#8221; cried Grunter and Squeaker.
	For they were the first and second little pigs, you
	see. Uncle Wiggily had saved Grunter from
	the bad wolf when the growling creature blew
	down Grunter&#8217;s straw house. And, in almost
	the same way, the bunny uncle had saved
	Squeaker, when his wooden house was blown
	over by the wolf. But Twisty-Tail, the third
	little pig, Uncle Wiggily had not yet helped.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look for Twisty-Tail to-day,&#8221; said the
	rabbit gentleman as he started off for his adventure
	walk, which he took every afternoon and
	morning.</p>

	<p>On and on went Uncle Wiggily Longears
	over the snow-covered fields and through the
	wood, until just as he was turning around the
	corner near an old red stump, the rabbit gentleman
	heard a clinkity-clankity sort of a noise, and
	the sound of whistling.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Some one is happy!&#8221; thought the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>bunny uncle. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good sign&#8212;whistling.
	I wonder who it is?&#8221;</p>

	<p>He looked around the stump corner and he
	saw a little animal chap, with blue rompers on,
	and a fur cap stuck back of his left ear, and this
	little animal chap was whistling away as merrily
	as a butterfly eating butterscotch candy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, that must be the third little pig!&#8221; exclaimed
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Hello!&#8221; called the
	rabbit gentleman. &#8220;Are you Twisty-Tail?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name,&#8221; answered the little pig,
	&#8220;and, as you see, I am building my house of
	bricks, just as it tells about in the Mother Goose
	book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And, surely enough, Twisty-Tail was building
	a little house of red bricks, and it was the tap-tap-tapping
	of his trowel, or mortar-shovel, that
	made the clinkity-clankity noise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you know me, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221; asked
	the piggie boy. &#8220;You see I am in a book.
	&#8216;Once upon a time there were three little pigs,
	<span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know all about you,&#8221; interrupted Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;I have met Mother Goose, and also
	your two brothers.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t know how to build the right
	kind of houses, and so the wolf got them,&#8221; said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>Twisty-Tail. &#8220;I am sorry, but it had to happen
	that way, just as it is in the book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily smiled, but said nothing.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I met a man with a load of bricks, and I
	begged some of them to build my house,&#8221; said
	Twisty-Tail. &#8220;No wolf can get me. No,
	sir-ee! I&#8217;ll build my house very strong, not weak
	like my brothers&#8217;. No, indeed!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you build your house,&#8221; offered
	Uncle Wiggily, kindly, and just as he and
	Twisty-Tail finished the brick house and put
	on the roof it began to rain and freeze.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are through just in time,&#8221; said Twisty-Tail,
	as he and the rabbit gentleman hurried inside.
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the wolf will come out in
	such weather.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But just as he said that and looked from the
	window, the little piggie boy gave a cry, and
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, here comes the bad animal now! But
	he can&#8217;t get in my house, or blow it over, &#8217;cause
	the book says he didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The wolf came up through the freezing rain
	and knocking on the third piggie boy&#8217;s brick
	house, said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No! No! By the hair of my chinny-chin-chin,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>I will not let you in!&#8221; grunted Twisty-Tail.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll puff and I&#8217;ll blow, and I&#8217;ll blow
	your house in!&#8221; howled the wolf.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t! The book says so!&#8221; laughed the
	little pig. &#8220;My house is a strong, brick one.
	You can&#8217;t get me!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just you wait!&#8221; growled the wolf. So he
	puffed out his cheeks, and he blew and he blew,
	but he could not blow down the brick house, because
	it was so strong.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m in no hurry,&#8221; the wolf said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	sit down and wait for you to come out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the wolf sat down on his tail to wait outside
	the brick house. After a while Twisty-Tail began
	to get hungry.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did you bring anything to eat, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221;
	he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;But if the old wolf would go away I&#8217;d
	take you where your two brothers are visiting
	with me in the Littletail family rabbit house and
	you could have all you want to eat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Rut the wolf would not go away, even when
	Uncle Wiggily asked him to, most politely, making
	a bow and twinkling his nose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay here all night,&#8221; the wolf
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>growled. &#8220;I am not going away. I am going
	to get that third little pig!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you? Well, we&#8217;ll see about that!&#8221; cried
	the rabbit gentleman. Then he took a rib out of
	his umbrella, and with a piece of his shoe lace
	(that he didn&#8217;t need) for a string he made a bow
	like the Indians used to have.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If I only had an arrow now I could shoot it
	from my umbrella-bow, hit the wolf on the nose
	and make him go away,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	Then he looked out of the window and saw
	where the rain, dripping from the roof, had
	frozen into long, sharp icicles.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;An icicle
	will make the best kind of an arrow! Now I&#8217;ll
	shoot the wolf, not hard enough to hurt him, but
	just hard enough to make him run away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Reaching out the window Uncle Wiggily
	broke off a sharp icicle. He put this ice arrow
	in his bow and, pulling back the shoe string,
	&#8220;twang!&#8221; he shot the wolf on the nose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, wow! Oh, double-wow! Oh, custard
	cake!&#8221; howled the wolf. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t in the
	Mother Goose book at all. Not a single pig did
	I get! Oh, my nose! Ouch!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he ran away, and Uncle Wiggily and
	Twisty-Tail could come safely out of the brick
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>house, which they did, hurrying home to the
	bunny house where Grunter and Squeaker were,
	to get something to eat. So everything came out
	right, you see, and Uncle Wiggily saved the
	three little pigs, one after the other.</p>

	<p>And if the canary bird doesn&#8217;t go swimming
	in the rice pudding, and eat out all the raisin
	seeds, so none is left for the parrot, I&#8217;ll tell you
	next of Uncle Wiggily and Little Boy Blue.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND LITTLE BOY BLUE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily</span>, are you very busy to-day?&#8221;
	asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper, who, with the old rabbit gentleman,
	was on a visit to the Bushytail family of
	squirrels in their hollow-tree home.</p>

	<p>After staying a while with the Littletail rabbits,
	when his hollow-stump bungalow had
	burned down, the bunny uncle went to visit
	Johnnie and Billie Bushytail.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you very busy, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221; asked
	the muskrat lady.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, no, Nurse Jane, not so very,&#8221; answered
	the bunny uncle. &#8220;Is there something
	you would like me to do for you?&#8221; he asked,
	with a polite bow.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Bushytail and I have just baked
	some pies,&#8221; said the muskrat lady, &#8220;and we
	thought perhaps you might like to take one to
	your friend, Grandfather Goosey Gander.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="illo">
		<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>
		<img src="images/fig042.jpg" width="500" height="735" alt="Uncle Wiggily blows on a horn. A boy watches." />
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, making his
	nose twinkle like a star on a Christmas tree
	in the dark. &#8220;Grandpa Goosey will be glad
	to get a pie. I&#8217;ll take him one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We have it all ready for you,&#8221; said Mrs.
	Bushytail, the squirrel mother of Johnnie and
	Billie, as she came in the sitting-room. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
	nice hot pie, and it will keep your paws warm,
	Uncle Wiggily, as you go over the ice and snow
	through the woods and across the fields.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	get ready and go at once.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily put on his warm fur coat, fastened
	his tall silk hat on his head, with his ears
	sticking up through holes cut in the brim, so it
	would not blow off, and then, taking his red,
	white and blue striped rheumatism crutch, that
	Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk,
	away he started. He carried the hot apple
	pie in a basket over his paw.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Grandpa Goosey will surely like this pie,&#8221;
	said Uncle Wiggily to himself, as he lifted the
	napkin that was over it to take a little sniff. &#8220;It
	makes me hungry myself. And how nice and
	warm it is,&#8221; he went on, as he put one cold paw
	in the basket to warm it; warm his paw I mean,
	not the basket.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>Over the fields and through the woods hopped
	the bunny uncle. It began to snow a little, but
	Uncle Wiggily did not mind that, for he was
	well wrapped up.</p>

	<p>When he was about halfway to Grandpa
	Goosey&#8217;s house Uncle Wiggily heard, from behind
	a pile of snow, a sad sort of crying voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed the bunny uncle, &#8220;that
	sounds like some one in trouble. I must see if
	I can help them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily looked over the top of the pile
	of snow, and, sitting on the ground, in front of
	a big icicle, was a boy all dressed in blue. Even
	his eyes were blue, but you could not very well
	see them, as they were filled with tears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	kindly. &#8220;This is quite too bad! What is the
	matter, little fellow; and who are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am Little Boy Blue, from the home of
	Mother Goose,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and the matter
	is that it&#8217;s lost!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is lost?&#8221; asked Uncle. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a
	penny I will help you find it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a penny,&#8221; answered Boy Blue. &#8220;It&#8217;s
	the hay stack which I have to sleep under. I
	can&#8217;t find it, and I must see where it is or else
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>things won&#8217;t be as they are in the Mother Goose
	book. Don&#8217;t you know what it says?&#8221;
	And he sang:</p>

	<div class="poem">
        <p>&#8220;Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,</p>
        <p>There are sheep in the meadow and cows in the corn.</p>
        <p>Where&#8217;s Little Boy Blue, who looks after the sheep?</p>
        <p>Why he&#8217;s under the hay stack, fast asleep.</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Only I can&#8217;t go to sleep under the hay stack,
	Uncle Wiggily, because I can&#8217;t find it. And, oh,
	dear! I don&#8217;t know what to do!&#8221; and Little Boy
	Blue cried harder than ever, so that some of his
	tears froze into little round marbles of ice, like
	hail stones.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There, there, now!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	kindly. &#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t find a hay stack
	in the winter. They are all covered with snow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; asked Boy Blue, real surprised
	like.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course, they are!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily,
	in his most jolly voice. &#8220;Besides, you wouldn&#8217;t
	want to sleep under a hay stack, even if there was
	one here, in the winter. You would catch cold
	and have the sniffle-snuffles.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, I might,&#8221; Boy Blue said, and he
	did not cry so hard now. &#8220;But that isn&#8217;t all,
	Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; he went on, nodding at the
	rabbit gentleman. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t all my trouble.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What else is the matter?&#8221; asked the bunny
	uncle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my horn,&#8221; spoke the little boy who
	looked after the cows and sheep. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make
	any music tunes on my horn. And I really have
	to blow my horn, you know, for it says in the
	Mother Goose book that I must. See, I can&#8217;t
	blow it a bit.&#8221; And Boy Blue put his horn to his
	lips, puffed out his cheeks and blew as hard as
	he could, but no sound came out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. The rabbit
	gentleman took the horn and he, also, tried to
	blow. He blew so hard he almost blew off his
	tall silk hat, but no sound came from the horn.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, I see what the trouble is!&#8221; cried the
	bunny uncle with a jolly laugh, looking down
	inside the &#8220;toot-tooter.&#8221; &#8220;It is so cold that the
	tunes are all frozen solid in your horn. But I
	have a hot apple pie here in my basket that I was
	taking to Grandpa Goosey Gander. I&#8217;ll hold
	the cold horn on the hot pie and the tunes will
	thaw out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, have you a pie in there?&#8221; asked Little
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>Boy Blue. &#8220;Is it the Christmas pie into which
	Little Jack Horner put in his thumb and pulled
	out a plum?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not quite, but nearly the same,&#8221; laughed
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Now to thaw out the frozen
	horn.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The bunny uncle put Little Boy Blue&#8217;s horn
	in the basket with the hot apple pie. Soon the
	ice was melted out of the horn, and Uncle Wiggily
	could blow on it, and play tunes, and so
	could Boy Blue. Tootity-toot-toot tunes they
	both played.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now you are all right!&#8221; cried the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;Come along with me and you may
	have a piece of this pie for yourself. And you
	may stay with Grandpa Goosey Gander until
	summer comes, and then blow your horn for the
	sheep in the meadow and the cows in the corn.
	There is no need, now, for you to stay out in the
	cold and look for a haystack under which to
	sleep.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I guess not,&#8221; said Boy Blue. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
	with you, Uncle Wiggily. And thank you, so
	much, for helping me. I don&#8217;t know what
	would have happened only for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray do not mention it,&#8221; politely said Uncle
	Wiggily with a laugh. Then he and little Boy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>Blue hurried on through the snow, and soon they
	were at Grandpa Goosey&#8217;s house with the warm
	apple pie, and oh! how good it tasted! Oh,
	yum-yum!</p>

	<p>And if the church steeple doesn&#8217;t drop the
	ding-dong bell down in the pulpit and scare the
	organ, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
	and Higgledee Piggledee.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND HIGGLEDEE PIGGLEDEE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">One</span> day Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice
	old gentleman rabbit, was sitting in an easy chair
	in the hollow-stump house of the Bushytail
	squirrel family, where he was paying a visit to
	Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two squirrel
	boys.</p>

	<p>There came a knock on the door, but the
	bunny uncle did not pay much attention to it,
	as he was sort of taking a little sleep after his
	dinner of cabbage soup with carrot ice cream
	on top.</p>

	<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
	housekeeper, went out in the hall, and when she
	came back, with her tail all tied up in a pink ribbon,
	(for she was sweeping) she said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Uncle Wiggily, a friend of yours has come
	to see you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A friend of mine!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily,
	awakening so suddenly that his nose stopped
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>twinkling. &#8220;I hope it isn&#8217;t the bad old fox from
	the Orange Mountains.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Nurse Jane with a smile,
	&#8220;it is a lady.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A lady?&#8221; exclaimed the old rabbit gentleman,
	getting up quickly, and looking in the
	glass to see that his ears were not criss-crossed.
	&#8220;Who can it be?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is Mother Goose,&#8221; went on Nurse Jane.
	&#8220;She says you were so kind as to help Little Boy
	Blue the other day, when his horn was frozen,
	and you thawed it on the warm pie, that perhaps
	you will now help her. She is in trouble.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;In trouble, eh?&#8221; exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
	sort of smoothing down his vest, fastidious like
	and stylish. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know she blew a horn.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nurse Jane. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
	bring her in and she can tell you, herself, what
	she wants.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; cried Mother Goose,
	as she set her broom down in one corner, for she
	never went out unless she carried it with her.
	She said she never could tell when she might
	have to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky. &#8220;Oh,
	Uncle Wiggily, I am in such a lot of trouble!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I will be very glad to help you if I
	can,&#8221; said the bunny uncle. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Higgledee Piggledee,&#8221; answered
	Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Higgledee Piggledee!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle
	Wiggily, &#8220;why that sounds <span class="keep_together">like&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my black hen,&#8221; went on Mother Goose.
	&#8220;You know how the verse goes in the book
	about me and my friends.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And, taking off her tall peaked hat, which she
	wore when she rode on the back of the old gander,
	Mother Goose sang:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Higgledee Piggledee, my black hen,</p>
		<p>She lays eggs for gentlemen.</p>
		<p>Sometimes nine and sometimes ten.</p>
		<p>Higgledee Piggledee, my black hen.</p>
		<p>Gentlemen come every day,</p>
		<p>To see what my black hen doth lay.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;what is the
	trouble? Has Higgledee Piggledee stopped
	laying? If she has I am afraid I can&#8217;t help you,
	for hens don&#8217;t lay many eggs in winter, you
	know.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that!&#8221; said Mother Goose,
	quickly. &#8220;Higgledee Piggledee lays as many
	eggs as ever for gentlemen&#8212;sometimes nine and
	sometimes ten. But the trouble is the gentlemen
	don&#8217;t get them.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they come for them?&#8221; asked Uncle
	Wiggily, sort of puzzled like and wondering.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they come every day,&#8221; said Mother
	Goose, &#8220;but there are no eggs for them. Some
	one else is getting the eggs Higgledee Piggledee
	lays.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose she eats them herself?&#8221; asked
	the old rabbit gentleman, in a whisper. &#8220;Hens
	sometimes do, you know.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not Higgledee Piggledee,&#8221; quickly spoke
	Mother Goose. &#8220;She is too good to do that.
	She and I are both worried about the missing
	eggs, and as you have been so kind I thought
	perhaps you could help us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then come right along to Higgledee Piggledee&#8217;s
	coop,&#8221; invited Mother Goose. &#8220;Maybe
	you can find out where her eggs go to. She lays
	them in her nest, comes off, once in a while, to
	get something to eat, but when she goes back to
	lay more eggs the first ones are gone.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily twinkled his nose, tied his ears
	in a hard knot, as he always did when he was
	thinking, and then, putting on his fur coat and
	taking his rheumatism crutch with him, he went
	out with Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily rode in his airship, made of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>a clothes-basket, with toy circus balloons on top,
	and Mother Goose rode on the back of a big
	gander, who was a brother to Grandfather
	Goosey Gander. Soon they were at the hen coop
	where Higgledee Piggledee lived.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily, I am so glad you
	came!&#8221; cackled the black hen. &#8220;Did Mother
	Goose tell you about the egg trouble?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She did, Higgledee Piggledee, and I will
	see if I can stop it. Now, you go on the nest and
	lay some eggs and then we will see what happens,&#8221;
	spoke Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>So Higgledee Piggledee, the black hen, laid
	some eggs for gentlemen, and then she went out
	in the yard to get some corn to eat, just as she
	always did. And, while she was gone, Uncle
	Wiggily hid himself in some straw in the hen
	coop. Pretty soon the old gentleman heard a
	gnawing, rustling sound and up out of a hole in
	the ground popped two big rats, with red eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did Higgledee Piggledee lay any eggs today?&#8221;
	asked one rat, in a whisper.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; spoke the other, &#8220;she did.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then we will take them,&#8221; said the first rat.
	&#8220;Hurray! More eggs for us! No gentlemen
	will get these eggs because we&#8217;ll take them ourselves.
	Hurray!&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>He got down on his back, with his paws sticking
	up in the air. Then the other rat rolled one
	of the black hen&#8217;s eggs over so the first rat could
	hold it in among his four legs. Next, the second
	rat took hold of the first rat&#8217;s tail and began pulling
	him along, egg and all, just as if he were a
	sled on a slippery hill, the rat sliding on his back
	over the smooth straw. And the eggs rode on
	the rat-sled as nicely as you please.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, jumping suddenly
	out of his hiding-place. &#8220;So this is where
	Higgledee Piggledee&#8217;s eggs have been going,
	eh? You rats have been taking them. Scatt!
	Shoo! Boo! Skedaddle! Scoot!&#8221;</p>

	<p>And the rats were so scared that they skedaddled
	away and shooed themselves and did everything
	else Mr. Longears told them to do, and
	they took no eggs that day. Then Uncle Wiggily
	showed Mother Goose the rat hole, and it
	was stopped up with stones so the rats could not
	come in the coop again. And ever after that
	Higgledee Piggledee, the black hen, could lay
	eggs for gentlemen, sometimes nine and sometimes
	ten, and there was no more trouble as there
	had been before Uncle Wiggily caught the rats
	and made them skedaddle.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"></a>So Mother Goose and the black hen thanked
	Uncle Wiggily very much. And if the stylish
	lady who lives next door doesn&#8217;t take our feather
	bed to wear on her hat when she goes to the moving
	pictures, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
	and Little Bo Peep.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND LITTLE BO PEEP</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">What</span> are you going to do, Nurse Jane?&#8221;
	asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
	as he saw the muskrat lady housekeeper
	going out in the kitchen one morning, with an
	apron on, and a dab of white flour on the end of
	her nose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am going to make a chocolate cake with
	carrot icing on top,&#8221; replied Miss Fuzzy
	Wuzzy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, good!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, and almost
	before he knew it he started to clap his
	paws, just as Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
	rabbit children, might have done, and as they
	often did do when they were pleased about anything.
	&#8220;I just love chocolate cake!&#8221; cried the
	bunny uncle, who was almost like a boy-bunny
	himself.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane. &#8220;Then I am
	glad I am going to make one,&#8221; and, going into
	the kitchen of the hollow-stump bungalow, she
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"></a>began rattling away among the pots, pans and
	kettles.</p>

	<p>For now Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily were
	living together once more in their own hollow-stump
	bungalow. It had burned down, you remember,
	but Uncle Wiggily had had it built up
	again, and now he did not have to visit around
	among his animal friends, though he still called
	on them every now and then.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; suddenly cried Nurse Jane from
	the kitchen. &#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy?&#8221;
	asked the bunny uncle. &#8220;Did you drop a pan
	on your paw?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; answered the muskrat
	lady. &#8220;It is worse than that. I can&#8217;t make the
	chocolate cake after all, I am sorry to say.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! That is too bad! Why not?&#8221;
	asked the bunny uncle, in a sad and sorrowful
	voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because there is no chocolate,&#8221; went on
	Nurse Jane. &#8220;Since we came to our new hollow-stump
	bungalow I have not made any cakes,
	and to-day I forgot to order the chocolate from
	the store for this one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the store and get the chocolate for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"></a>you. In fact, I would go to two stores and part
	of another one for the sake of having a chocolate
	cake.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; spoke Nurse Jane. &#8220;If you get
	me the chocolate I&#8217;ll make one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Putting on his overcoat, with his tall silk hat
	tied down over his ears so they would not blow
	away&#8212;I mean so his hat would not blow off&#8212;and
	with his rheumatism crutch under his paw,
	off started the old gentleman rabbit, across the
	fields and through the woods to the chocolate
	store.</p>

	<p>After buying what he wanted for Nurse Jane&#8217;s
	cake, the old gentleman rabbit started back for
	the hollow-stump bungalow. On the way, he
	passed a toy store, and he stopped to look in the
	window at the pop-guns, the spinning-tops, the
	dolls, the Noah&#8217;s Arks, with the animals marching
	out of them, and all things like that.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It makes me young again to look at toys,&#8221;
	said the bunny uncle. Then he went on a little
	farther until, all at once, as he was passing a
	bush, he heard from behind it the sound of crying.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Some one in trouble again,&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I wonder if it can be Little
	Boy Blue?&#8221; He looked, but, instead of seeing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"></a>the sheep-boy, whom he had once helped, Uncle
	Wiggily saw a little girl.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Who are you?&#8221; the bunny uncle
	asked, &#8220;and what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am Little Bo Peep,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and
	I have lost my sheep, and don&#8217;t know where to
	find them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, let them alone, and they&#8217;ll come home,
	wagging their tails behind them,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily quickly, and he laughed jolly like and
	happy, because he had made a rhyme to go with
	what Bo Peep said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that&#8217;s the way it is in the Mother
	Goose book,&#8221; said Little Bo Peep, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve
	waited and waited, and let them alone ever so
	long, but they haven&#8217;t come home. And now
	I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll freeze.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That&#8217;s so. It <i>is</i> pretty cold for sheep
	to be out,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, as he looked
	across the snow-covered field, and toward the
	woods where there were icicles hanging down
	from the trees.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look here, Little Bo Peep,&#8221; went on the
	bunny uncle. &#8220;I think your sheep must have
	gone home long ago, wagging their tails behind
	them. And you, too, had better run home to
	Mother Goose. Tell her you met me and that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"></a>I sent you home. And, if I find your sheep, I&#8217;ll
	send them along, too. So don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, but I don&#8217;t like to go home without my
	sheep,&#8221; said Bo Peep, and tears came into her
	eyes. &#8220;I ought to bring them with me. But today
	I went skating on Crystal Lake, up in the
	Lemon-Orange Mountains, and I forgot all
	about my sheep. Now I am afraid to go home
	without them. Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute, then he
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! I have it! I know where I can get
	you some sheep to take home with you. Then
	Mother Goose will say it is all right. Come
	with me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Bo Peep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;To get you some sheep.&#8221; And Uncle Wiggily
	led the little shepardess girl back to the toy
	store, in the window of which he had stopped to
	look a while ago.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Give Bo Peep some of your toy woolly
	sheep, if you please,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily to the
	toy store man. &#8220;She can take them home with
	her, while her own sheep are safe in some warm
	place, I&#8217;m sure. But now she must have some
	sort of sheep to take home with her in place of
	the lost ones, so it will come out all right, as it is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"></a>in the book. And these toy woolly sheep will
	do as well as any; won&#8217;t they, Little Bo Peep?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, they will; thank you very much,
	Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; answered Bo Peep, making a
	pretty little bow. Then the rabbit gentleman
	bought her ten little toy, woolly sheep, each one
	with a tail which Bo Peep could wag for them,
	and one toy lamb went: &#8220;Baa! Baa! Baa!&#8221; as
	real as anything, having a little phonograph
	talking machine inside him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now I can go home to Mother Goose and
	make believe these are my lost sheep,&#8221; said Bo
	Peep, &#8220;and it will be all right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And here is a piece of chocolate for you to
	eat,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. Then Bo Peep hurried
	home with her fleecy toy sheep, and, later
	on, she found her real ones, all nice and warm, in
	the barn where the Cow with the Crumpled
	Horn lived. Mother Goose laughed in her jolliest
	way when she saw the toy sheep Uncle Wiggily
	had bought Bo Peep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like him!&#8221; said Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>And if the goldfish doesn&#8217;t climb out of his
	tank and hide in the sardine tin, where the stuffed
	olives can&#8217;t find him, I&#8217;ll tell you next about
	Uncle Wiggily and Tommie Tucker.</p>

<div id="chapter_8" class="chapter">

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND TOMMIE TUCKER</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Oh</span>, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; called Susie Littletail,
	the rabbit girl, one day, as she went over to
	see her bunny uncle in his hollow-stump bungalow.
	&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Isn&#8217;t it too bad?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t what too bad?&#8221; asked the old gentleman
	rabbit, as he scratched his nose with his left
	ear, and put his glasses in his pocket, for he was
	tired of reading the paper, and felt like going out
	for a walk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Too bad about my talking and singing doll,
	that I got for Christmas,&#8221; said Susie. &#8220;She
	won&#8217;t sing any more. Something inside her is
	broken.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Broken? That&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	kindly. &#8220;Let me see. What&#8217;s her name?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sallieann Peachbasket Shortcake,&#8221; answered
	Susie.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What a funny name,&#8221; laughed the bunny
	uncle.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily took Susie&#8217;s doll, which had
	been given her at Christmas, and looked at it.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"></a>Inside the doll was a sort of phonograph, or talking
	machine&#8212;a very small one, you know&#8212;and
	when you pushed on a little button in back of
	the doll&#8217;s dress she would laugh and talk. But,
	best of all, when she was in working order, she
	would sing a verse, which went something like
	this:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll like my little song,</p>
		<p>I will not sing it very long.</p>
		<p>I have two shoes upon my feet,</p>
		<p>And when I&#8217;m hungry, then I eat.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily wound up the spring in the
	doll&#8217;s side, and then he pressed the button&#8212;like
	a shoe button&#8212;in her back. But this time Susie&#8217;s
	doll did not talk, she did not laugh, and, instead
	of singing, she only made a scratchy noise like a
	phonograph when it doesn&#8217;t want to play, or like
	Bully No-Tail, the frog boy, when he has a cold
	in his head.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! This is quite too bad!&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Quite indeed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it!&#8221; exclaimed Susie. &#8220;Do you think
	you can fix her, Uncle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Mr. Longears turned the doll upside down
	and shook her. Things rattled inside her, but
	even then she did not sing.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"></a>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; cried Susie, her little pink nose
	going twinkle-inkle, just as did Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s.
	&#8220;What can we do?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You leave it to me, Susie,&#8221; spoke the old rabbit
	gentleman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the doll to the toy shop,
	where I bought Little Bo Peep&#8217;s sheep, and have
	her mended.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, goodie!&#8221; cried Susie, clasping her
	paws. &#8220;Now I know it will be all right,&#8221; and
	she kissed Uncle Wiggily right between his ears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure I <i>hope</i> it will be all right after
	<i>that</i>,&#8221; said the bunny uncle, laughing, and feeling
	sort of tickled inside.</p>

	<p>Off hopped Uncle Wiggily to the toy shop,
	and there he found the same monkey-doodle gentleman
	who had sold him the toy woolly sheep
	for Little Bo Peep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here is more trouble,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Can you fix Susie&#8217;s doll so she will sing, for
	the doll is a little girl one, just like Susie, and
	her name is Sallieann Peachbasket Shortcake.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The monkey-doodle man in the toy store
	looked at the doll.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I can fix her,&#8221; he said. Going in his back-room
	workshop, where there were rocking-horses
	that needed new legs, wooden soldiers
	who had lost their guns, and steamboats that had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"></a>forgotten their whistles, the toy man soon had
	Susie&#8217;s doll mended again as well as ever. So
	that she said: &#8220;Papa! Mama! I love you! I
	am hungry!&#8221; And she laughed: &#8220;Ha! Ha!
	Ho! Ho!&#8221; and she sang:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;I am a little dollie,</p>
		<p>&#8217;Bout one year old.</p>
		<p>Please take me where it&#8217;s warm, for I</p>
		<p>Am feeling rather cold.</p>
		<p>If you&#8217;re not in a hurry,</p>
		<p>It won&#8217;t take me very long,</p>
		<p>To whistle or to sing for you</p>
		<p>My pretty little song.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily when he
	heard this. &#8220;Susie&#8217;s dolly is all right again.
	Thank you, Mr. Monkey-Doodle, I&#8217;ll take her
	to Susie.&#8221; Then Uncle Wiggily paid the toy-store
	keeper and hurried off with Susie&#8217;s doll.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far before,
	all at once from around the corner of a snowbank
	he heard a sad, little voice crying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; said the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;Some one else is in trouble. I wonder who it
	can be this time?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"></a>He looked, and saw a little boy standing in
	the snow.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly
	voice. &#8220;Who are you, and what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am Little Tommie Tucker,&#8221; was the answer.
	&#8220;And the matter is I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hungry, eh?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you eat?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I guess you forgot about me and the Mother
	Goose book,&#8221; spoke the boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m in that book,
	and it says about me:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Little Tommie Tucker,</p>
		<p>Must sing for his supper.</p>
		<p>What shall he eat?</p>
		<p>Jam and bread and butter.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Why
	don&#8217;t you sing?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; answered Tommie. &#8220;That&#8217;s
	the trouble. I have caught such a cold that I
	can&#8217;t sing. And if I don&#8217;t sing Mother Goose
	won&#8217;t know it is I, and she won&#8217;t give me any
	supper. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! And I am so
	hungry!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There now, there! Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; kindly said
	the bunny uncle, patting Tommie Tucker on the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"></a>head. &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon have you singing for your supper.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But how can you when I have such a cold?&#8221;
	asked the little boy. &#8220;Listen. I am as hoarse
	as a crow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And, truly, he could no more sing than a
	rusty gate, or a last year&#8217;s door-knob.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, I can soon fix that!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;See, here I have Susie Littletail&#8217;s talking
	and singing doll, which I have just had mended.
	Now you take the doll in your pocket, go to
	Mother Goose, and when she asks you to sing
	for your supper, just push the button in the doll&#8217;s
	back. Then the doll will sing and Mother Goose
	will think it is you, and give you bread and jam.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, how fine!&#8221; cried Tommie Tucker.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But afterward,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, slowly
	shaking his paw at Tommie, &#8220;afterward you
	must tell Mother Goose all about the little joke
	you played, or it would not be fair. Tell her the
	doll sang and not you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Tommie. He and Uncle Wiggily
	went to Mother Goose&#8217;s house, and when
	Tommie had to sing for his supper the doll did
	it for him. And when Mother Goose heard
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"></a>about it she said it was a fine trick, and that
	Uncle Wiggily was very good to think of it.</p>

	<p>Then the bunny uncle took Susie&#8217;s mended
	doll to her, and the next day Tommie&#8217;s cold was
	all better and he could sing for his supper himself,
	just as the book tells about.</p>

	<p>And if the little mouse doesn&#8217;t go to sleep in
	the cat&#8217;s cradle and scare the milk bottle so it
	rolls off the back stoop, I&#8217;ll tell you next about
	Uncle Wiggily and Pussy Cat Mole.</p>

	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND PUSSY CAT MOLE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Oh</span>, dear! I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s ever coming!&#8221;
	said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper, as she stood at the window
	of the hollow-stump bungalow one day, and
	looked down through the woods.</p>

	<p>&#8220;For whom are you looking, Nurse Jane?&#8221;
	asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;If it&#8217;s for the letter-man, I think he
	went past some time ago.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t looking for the letter-man,&#8221;
	said the muskrat lady. &#8220;I am expecting a messenger-boy
	cat to bring home my new dress from
	the dressmaker&#8217;s, but I don&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A new dress, eh?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Pray, what is going on?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My dress is going on me, as soon as it comes
	home, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; the muskrat lady answered,
	laughingly. &#8220;And then I am going
	on over to the house of Mrs. Wibblewobble, the
	duck lady. She and I are going to have a little
	tea party together, if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"></a>&#8220;Mind? Certainly not! I&#8217;m glad to have
	you go out and enjoy yourself,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	jolly like and also laughing.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t go if my new dress doesn&#8217;t come,&#8221;
	went on Nurse Jane. &#8220;That is, I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; said the bunny uncle, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	tell you what I&#8217;ll do, Nurse Jane, I&#8217;ll go for your
	dress myself and bring it home. I have nothing
	to do. I&#8217;ll go get your dress at the dressmaker&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Will you, really?&#8221; cried the muskrat lady.
	&#8220;That will be fine! Then I can curl my whiskers
	and tie a new pink bow for my tail. You
	are very good, Uncle Wiggily.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, not at all! Not at all!&#8221; the rabbit gentleman
	said, modest like and shy. Then he
	hopped out of the hollow-stump bungalow and
	across the fields and through the woods to where
	Nurse Jane&#8217;s dressmaker made dresses.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Nurse Jane&#8217;s dress!&#8221; exclaimed
	Mrs. Spin-Spider, who wove silk for all the
	dresses worn by the lady animals of Woodland.
	&#8220;Yes, I have just finished it. I was about to call
	a messenger-boy cat and send it home, but now
	you are here you may take it. And here is some
	cloth I had left over. Nurse Jane might want it
	if ever she tears a hole in her dress.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"></a>Uncle Wiggily put the extra pieces of cloth
	in his pocket, and then Mrs. Spin-Spider
	wrapped Nurse Jane&#8217;s dress up nicely for him
	in tissue paper, as fine as the web which she had
	spun for the silk, and the rabbit gentleman
	started back to the hollow-stump bungalow.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Spin-Spider lived on Second Mountain,
	and, as Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s bungalow was on First
	Mountain, he had quite a way to go to get home.
	And when he was about half way there he passed
	a little house near a gray rock that looked like
	an eagle, and in the house he heard a voice saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, isn&#8217;t it too bad? Now I
	can&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! I wonder who that can be?&#8221; thought
	the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;It sounds like some one
	in trouble. I will ask if I can do anything to
	help.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The rabbit gentleman knocked on the door
	of the little house, and a voice said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily entered, and there in the
	middle of the room he saw a pussy cat lady holding
	up a dress with a big hole burned in it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, but who are you and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"></a>what is the matter?&#8221; politely asked the bunny
	uncle, making a low bow.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My name is Pussy Cat Mole,&#8221; was the answer,
	&#8220;and you can see the trouble for yourself.
	I am Pussy Cat Mole; I jumped over a coal,
	<span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;In your best petticoat burned a great hole,&#8221;
	finished Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I know you, now.
	You are from Mother Goose&#8217;s book and I met
	you at a party in Belleville, where they have a
	bluebell flower on the school to call the animal
	children to their lessons.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; meowed Pussy Cat Mole. &#8220;I
	am glad you remember me, Uncle Wiggily. It
	was at a party I met you, and now I am going
	to another. Or, rather, I was going until I
	jumped over a coal, and in my best petticoat
	burned a great hole. Now I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; and she
	held up the burned dress, sorrowful like and sad.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How did you happen to jump over the
	coal?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, it fell out of my stove,&#8221; said Pussy Cat
	Mole, &#8220;and I jumped over it in a hurry to get
	the fire shovel to take it up. That&#8217;s how I burned
	my dress. And now I can&#8217;t go to the party, for
	it was my best petticoat, and Mrs. Wibblewobble,
	the duck lady, asked me to be there early,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"></a>too; and now&#8212;Oh, dear!&#8221; and Pussy Cat Mole
	felt very badly, indeed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mrs. Wibblewobble&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Why, Nurse Jane is going there to a
	little tea party, too! This is her new dress I am
	taking home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Has she burned a hole in it?&#8221; asked the
	pussy cat lady.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, she has not, I am glad to say,&#8221; the bunny
	uncle replied. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t had it on, yet.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then she can go to the party, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221;
	said Pussy Cat Mole, sorrowfully. &#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, you can go!&#8221; suddenly cried Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;See here! I have some extra pieces
	of cloth, left over when Mrs. Spin-Spider made
	Nurse Jane&#8217;s dress. Now you can take these
	pieces of cloth and mend the hole burned by
	the coal in your best petticoat. Then you can
	go to the party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, so I can,&#8221; meowed the pussy cat. So,
	with a needle and thread, and the cloth she
	mended her best petticoat.</p>

	<p>All around the edges and over the top of the
	burned hole the pussy cat lady sewed the left-over
	pieces of Nurse Jane&#8217;s dress which was almost
	the same color. Then, when the mended
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"></a>place was pressed with a warm flat-iron, Uncle
	Wiggily cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;You would never know there had been a
	burned hole!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; meowed Pussy Cat Mole.
	&#8220;Thank you so much, Uncle Wiggily, for helping
	me!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray do not mention it,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman,
	bashful like and casual. Then he hurried
	to the hollow-stump bungalow with Nurse
	Jane&#8217;s dress, and the muskrat lady said he had
	done just right to help mend Pussy Cat Mole&#8217;s
	dress with the left-over pieces. So she and
	Nurse Jane both went to Mrs. Wibblewobble&#8217;s
	little tea party, and had a good time.</p>

	<p>And so, you see, it came out just as it did in
	the book: Pussy Cat Mole jumped over a coal,
	and in her best petticoat burned a great hole.
	But the hole it was mended, and my story is
	ended. Only never before was it known how the
	hole was mended. Uncle Wiggily did it.</p>

	<p>And, if the apple doesn&#8217;t jump out of the
	peach dumpling and hide in the lemon pie when
	the knife and fork try to play tag with it, I&#8217;ll tell
	you next about Uncle Wiggily and Jack and
	Jill, and it will be a Valentine story.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND JACK AND JILL</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old gentleman
	rabbit, was asleep in an easy chair in
	his hollow-stump bungalow one morning when
	he heard some one calling:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hi, Jack! Ho, Jill! Where are you? Come
	at once, if you please!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! What&#8217;s that? Some one calling me?&#8221;
	asked the bunny uncle, sitting up so suddenly
	that he knocked over his red, white and blue
	striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch that
	Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
	housekeeper, had gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk.
	&#8220;Is any one calling me?&#8221; asked Mr.
	Longears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
	&#8220;That&#8217;s Mother Goose calling Jack and Jill to
	get a pail of water.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh! is that all?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman,
	rubbing his pink eyes and making his nose
	twinkle like the sharp end of an ice cream cone.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"></a>&#8220;Just Mother Goose calling Jack and Jill; eh?
	Well, I&#8217;ll go out and see if I can find them for
	her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily was always that way, you
	know, wanting to help some one. This time it
	was Mother Goose. His new hollow-stump
	bungalow was built right near where Mother
	Goose lived, with all her big family; Peter-Peter
	Pumpkin-Eater, Little Jack Horner, Bo Peep
	and many others.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ho, Jack! Hi, Jill! Where are you?&#8221;
	called Mother Goose, as Uncle Wiggily came
	out of his hollow stump.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you find those two children?&#8221; asked
	the rabbit gentleman, making a polite good
	morning bow.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say I cannot,&#8221; answered
	Mother Goose. &#8220;They were over to see the Old
	Woman Who Lives in a Shoe, a while ago, but
	where they are now I can&#8217;t guess, and I need a
	pail of water for Simple Simon to go fishing in,
	for to catch a whale.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get the water for you,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily, taking the pail. &#8220;Perhaps Jack and
	Jill are off playing somewhere, and they have
	forgotten all about getting the water.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And I suppose they&#8217;ll forget about tumbling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"></a>down hill, too,&#8221; went on Mother Goose, sort of
	nervous like. &#8220;But they must not. If they don&#8217;t
	fall down, so Jack can break his crown, it won&#8217;t
	be like the story in my book, and everything will
	be upside down.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So Jack has to break his crown; eh?&#8221; asked
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;That&#8217;s too bad. I hope he
	won&#8217;t hurt himself too much.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s used to it by this time,&#8221; Mother
	Goose said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t mind falling, nor does
	Jill mind tumbling down after.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well, then, I&#8217;ll get the pail of water
	for you,&#8221; spoke the bunny uncle, &#8220;and Jack and
	Jill can do the tumbling-down-hill part.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily took the water pail and started
	for the hill, on top of which was the well owned
	by Mother Goose. As the bunny uncle was
	walking along he suddenly heard a voice calling
	to him from behind a bush.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily, will you do me a
	favor?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I certainly will,&#8221; said Mr. Longears, &#8220;but
	who are you, and where are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here I am, over here,&#8221; the voice went on.
	&#8220;I&#8217;m Jack, and will you please give this to Jill
	when you see her?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Out from behind the bush stepped Jack, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"></a>little Mother Goose boy. In his hand he held a
	piece of white birch bark, prettily colored red,
	green and pink, and on it was a little verse which
	read:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Can you tell me, pretty maid,</p>
		<p>Tell me and not be afraid,</p>
		<p>Who&#8217;s the sweetest girl, and true?&#8212;</p>
		<p>I can; for she&#8217;s surely you!&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s this?&#8221; asked Uncle
	Wiggily, in surprise. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a valentine for Jill,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;To-day
	is Valentine&#8217;s Day, you see, but I don&#8217;t want
	Jill to know I sent it, so I went off here and hid
	until I could see you to ask you to take it to her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said,
	laughing. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take your valentine to Jill for
	you. So that&#8217;s why you weren&#8217;t &#8216;round to get
	the pail of water; is it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;I wanted to finish
	making my valentine. As soon as you give it
	to Jill I&#8217;ll get the water.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that,&#8221; said the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the water, just you do the falling-down-hill
	part. I&#8217;m too old for that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Jack. Then Uncle Wiggily
	went on up the hill, and pretty soon he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"></a>heard some one else calling him, and, all of a
	sudden, out from behind a stump stepped Jill,
	the little Mother Goose girl.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; said Jill, bashfully
	holding out a pretty red leaf, shaped like a heart,
	&#8220;will you please give this to Jack. I don&#8217;t want
	him to know I sent it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll give it to him,&#8221; promised the
	rabbit gentleman. &#8220;It&#8217;s a valentine, I suppose,
	and here is something for you,&#8221; and while Jill
	was reading the valentine Jack had sent her,
	Uncle Wiggily looked at the red heart-shaped
	leaf. On it Jill had written in blue ink:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;One day when I went to school,</p>
		<p>Teacher taught to me this rule:</p>
		<p>Eight and one add up to nine;</p>
		<p>So I&#8217;ll be your valentine.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;My, that&#8217;s nice!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	laughing. &#8220;So that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re hiding off here
	for, Jill, to make a valentine for Jack?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; Jill answered, blushing sort of
	pink, like the frosting on a strawberry cake.
	&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want Jack to know it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never tell him,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>So he went on up the hill to get a pail of water
	for Mother Goose. And on his way back he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"></a>gave Jill&#8217;s valentine to Jack, who liked it very
	much.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now, since you got the water, Jill
	and I will go tumble down hill,&#8221; said Jack, as
	he found the little girl, where she was reading
	his valentine again. Up the hill they went, near
	the well of water, and Jack fell down, and broke
	his crown, while Jill came tumbling after, while
	Uncle Wiggily looked on and laughed. So it
	all happened just as it did in the book, you see.</p>

	<p>Mother Goose was very glad Uncle Wiggily
	had brought the water for Simple Simon to go
	fishing in, and that afternoon she gave a valentine
	party for Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
	Bushytail squirrel brothers, Nannie and Billie
	Wagtail, the goats, and all the other animal
	friends of Uncle Wiggily. And every one had
	a fine time.</p>

	<p>And if the cup doesn&#8217;t jump out of the saucer
	and hide in the spoonholder, where the coffee
	cake can&#8217;t find it, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle
	Wiggily and little Jack Horner.</p>

	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Well</span>, I think I&#8217;ll go for a walk,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, one
	afternoon, when he was sitting out on the front
	porch of his hollow-stump bungalow. He had
	just eaten a nice dinner that Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, had gotten
	ready for him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Go for a walk!&#8221; exclaimed Nurse Jane.
	&#8220;Why, Mr. Longears, excuse me for saying so,
	but you went walking this morning.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know I did,&#8221; answered the bunny uncle,
	&#8220;but no adventure happened to me then. I
	don&#8217;t really count it a good day unless I have had
	an adventure. So I&#8217;ll go walking again, and
	perhaps I may find one. If I do, I&#8217;ll come home
	and tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Nurse Jane. &#8220;You are a
	funny rabbit, to be sure! Going off in the woods,
	looking for adventures when you might sit
	quietly here on the bungalow front porch.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"></a>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; laughed Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to be too quiet. Off I go!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope you have a nice adventure!&#8221; Nurse
	Jane called after him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily, politely.</p>

	<p>Away over the fields and through the woods
	went the bunny uncle, looking on all sides for
	an adventure, when, all of a sudden he heard behind
	him a sound that went:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Honk! Honk! Honkity-honk-honk!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That must be a wild goose!&#8221; thought
	the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>So he looked up in the air, over his head, where
	the wild geese always fly, but, instead of seeing
	any of the big birds, Uncle Wiggily felt something
	whizz past him, and again he heard the
	loud &#8220;Honk-honk!&#8221; noise, and then he sneezed,
	for a lot of dust from the road flew up his nose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; he heard some one cry. &#8220;We nearly
	ran over a rabbit! Did you see?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And a big automobile, with real people in it,
	shot past. It was the horn of the auto that Uncle
	Wiggily had heard, and not a wild goose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That came pretty close to me,&#8221; thought
	Uncle Wiggily, as the auto went on down the
	road. &#8220;I never ride my automobile as fast as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"></a>that, even when I sprinkle pepper on the bologna
	sausage tires. I don&#8217;t like to scare any
	one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Perhaps the people in the auto did not mean
	to so nearly run over Uncle Wiggily. Let us
	hope so.</p>

	<p>The old gentleman rabbit hopped on down
	the road, that was between the woods and the
	fields, and, pretty soon, he saw something bright
	and shining in the dust, near where the auto had
	passed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, maybe that&#8217;s a diamond,&#8221; he said, as he
	stooped over to pick it up. But it was only a
	shiny button-hook, and not a diamond at all.
	Some one in the automobile had dropped it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll put it in my pocket,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily to himself. &#8220;It may come in useful to
	button Nurse Jane&#8217;s shoes, or mine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The bunny gentleman went on a little farther,
	and, pretty soon, he came to a tiny house, with
	a red chimney sticking up out of the roof.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! I wonder who lives there?&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>He stood still for a moment, looking through
	his glasses at the house and then, all of a sudden,
	he saw a little lady, with a tall, peaked hat
	on, run out and look up and down the road. Her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"></a>hat was just like an ice cream cone turned upside
	down. Only don&#8217;t turn your ice cream cone
	upside down if it has any cream in it, for you
	might spill your treat.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Help! Help! Help!&#8221; cried the lady, who
	had come out of the house with the red chimney.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That sounds like trouble!&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;I think I had better hurry over there
	and see what it is all about.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He hopped over toward the little house, and,
	when he reached it he saw that the little lady
	who was calling for help was Mother Goose herself.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; exclaimed Mother
	Goose. &#8220;I am so glad to see you! Will you
	please go for help for me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, certainly I will,&#8221; answered the bunny
	gentleman. &#8220;But what kind of help do you
	want; help for the kitchen, or a wash-lady help
	<span class="keep_together">or&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Neither of those,&#8221; said Mother Goose. &#8220;I
	want help so Little Jack Horner can get his
	thumb out of the pie.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Get his thumb out of the pie!&#8221; cried Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;What in the world do you mean?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, you see it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; went on Mother
	Goose. &#8220;Jack Horner lives here. You must
	<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"></a>have heard about him. He is in my book. His
	verse goes like this:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Little Jack Horner</p>
		<p>Sat in a corner,</p>
		<p>Eating a Christmas pie.</p>
		<p>He put in his thumb,</p>
		<p>And pulled out a plum,</p>
		<p>And said what a great boy am I.</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy I mean,&#8221; cried Mother Goose.
	&#8220;But the trouble is that Jack can&#8217;t get his thumb
	out. He put it in the pie, to pull out the plum,
	but it won&#8217;t come out&#8212;neither the plum nor the
	thumb. They are stuck fast for some reason or
	other. I wish you&#8217;d go for Dr. Possum, so he
	can help us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;But is Jack
	Horner sitting in a corner, as it says in the
	book?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s doing that all right,&#8221; answered
	Mother Goose. &#8220;But, corner or no corner, he
	can&#8217;t pull out his thumb.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get the doctor at once,&#8221; promised the
	bunny uncle. He hurried over to Dr. Possum&#8217;s
	house, but could not find him, as Dr. Possum
	was, just then, called to see Jillie Longtail, who
	had the mouse-trap fever.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"></a>&#8220;Dr. Possum not in!&#8221; cried Mother Goose,
	when Uncle Wiggily had hopped back and told
	her. &#8220;That&#8217;s too bad! Oh, we must do something
	for Jack. He&#8217;s crying and going on terribly
	because he can&#8217;t get his thumb out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then,
	putting his paw in his pocket, he felt the button-hook
	which had dropped from the automobile
	that nearly ran over him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! I know what to do!&#8221; cried the bunny
	uncle, suddenly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull out Jack&#8217;s thumb myself, with this
	button-hook,&#8221; said Mr. Longears. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make
	him all right without waiting for Dr. Possum.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Into the room, where, in the corner, Jack was
	sitting, went the bunny gentleman. There he
	saw the Christmas-pie boy, with his thumb away
	down deep under the top crust.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
	such trouble. Oh, dear! I can&#8217;t get my thumb
	out. It must be caught on the edge of the pan,
	or something!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it out for you.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="illo">
		<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"></a>
		<img src="images/fig090.jpg" width="500" height="743" alt="Uncle Wiggily tips his hat to Mother Hubbard." />
		<p class="caption">&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d go for Dr. Possum.&#8221;</p>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"></a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>So he put the button-hook through the hole
	in the top pie crust, close to Jack&#8217;s thumb. Then,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"></a>getting the hook on the plum, Uncle Wiggily,
	with his strong paws, pulled and pulled and
	pulled, <span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

	<p>All of a sudden out came the plum and Jack
	Homer&#8217;s thumb, and they weren&#8217;t stuck fast any
	more.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, so much!&#8221; said Jack, as he
	got up out of his corner.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily,
	politely. &#8220;I am glad I could help you, and
	it also makes an adventure for me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then Jack Horner, went back to his corner
	and ate the plum that stuck to his thumb. And
	Uncle Wiggily, putting the button-hook back
	in his pocket, went on to his hollow-stump bungalow.
	He had had his adventure.</p>

	<p>So everything came out all right, you see, and
	if the snow-shovel doesn&#8217;t go off by itself, sliding
	down hill with the ash can, when it ought
	to be boiling the cups and saucers for supper,
	I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Mr.
	Pop-Goes.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND MR. POP-GOES</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily</span>,&#8221; said Mrs. Littletail, the
	rabbit lady, one morning, as she came in the
	dining-room where Mr. Longears was reading
	the cabbage leaf paper after breakfast, &#8220;Uncle
	Wiggily, I don&#8217;t like you to go out in such a
	storm as this, but I do need some things from the
	store, and I have no one to send.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll be only too glad to go,&#8221; cried the
	bunny uncle, who was spending a few days visiting
	the Littletail family in their underground
	burrow-house. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t snowing very hard,&#8221;
	and he looked out through the window, which
	was up a little way above ground to make the
	burrow light. &#8220;What do you want, Mrs. Littletail?&#8221;
	he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I want a loaf of bread and some sugar,&#8221;
	said the bunny mother of Sammie and Susie Littletail.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you shall certainly have what you
	want!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily, as he got ready
	to go to the store. Soon he was on his way, wearing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"></a>his fur coat, and hopping along on his corn-stalk
	rheumatism crutch, while his pink nose
	was twinkling in the frosty air like a red lantern
	on the back of an automobile.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A loaf of home-made bread and three and a
	half pounds of granulated sugar,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily to the monkey-doodle gentleman who
	kept the grocery store. &#8220;And the best that you
	have, if you please, as it&#8217;s for Mrs. Littletail.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You shall certainly have the best!&#8221; cried the
	monkey-doodle gentleman, with a jolly laugh.
	And while he was wrapping up the things for
	Uncle Wiggily to carry home, all at once there
	sounded in the store a loud:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pop!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily,
	surprised like and excited. &#8220;I heard a bang like
	a gun. Are there any hunter-men, with their
	dogs about? If there are I must be careful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, that wasn&#8217;t a gun,&#8221; said the monkey-doodle
	gentleman. &#8220;That was only one of the
	toy balloons in my window. I had some left
	over from last year, so I blew them up and put
	them in my window to make it look pretty. Now
	and then one of them bursts.&#8221; And just then,
	surely enough, &#8220;Pop! Bang!&#8221; went another
	toy balloon, bursting and shriveling all up.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"></a>Uncle Wiggily looked in the front window of
	the store and saw some blown-up balloons that
	had not burst.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take two of those,&#8221; he said to the monkey-doodle
	gentleman. &#8220;Sammie and Susie Littletail
	will like to play with them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Better take two or three,&#8221; said the monkey-doodle
	gentleman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you have them
	cheap, as they are old balloons, and they will
	burst easily.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So he let the air out of four balloons and gave
	them to Uncle Wiggily to take home to the
	bunny children.</p>

	<p>The rabbit gentleman started off through the
	snow-storm toward the underground house, but
	he had not gone very far before, just as he was
	coming out from behind a big stump, he heard
	voices talking.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tell you how we can get those rabbits,&#8221;
	Uncle Wiggily heard one voice say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
	crawl down in the burrow, and as soon as they
	see me they&#8217;ll be scared and run out&#8212;Uncle
	Wiggily, Mrs. Littletail, the two children, Nurse
	Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy and all. Then you can grab
	them, Mr. Bigtail! I am glad I happened to
	meet you!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, ha!&#8221; thought Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Mr.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"></a>Bigtail! I ought to know that name. It&#8217;s the
	fox, and he and some one else seem to be after
	us rabbits. But I thought the fox promised to be
	good and let me alone. He must have changed
	his mind.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily peeked cautiously around the
	stump, taking care to make no noise, and there
	he saw a fox and another animal talking. And
	the rabbit gentleman saw that it was not the fox
	who had promised to be good, but another one,
	of the same name, who was bad.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll go down the hole and drive out the
	rabbits and you can grab them,&#8221; said the queer
	animal.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; growled the fox, &#8220;but to
	whom have I the honor of speaking?&#8221; That
	was his way of asking the name of the other animal,
	you see.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m called Mr. Pop-Goes,&#8221; said the
	other.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mr. Pop-Goes! What a queer name,&#8221; said
	the fox, and all the while Uncle Wiggily was
	listening with his big ears, and wondering what
	it all meant.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Pop-Goes isn&#8217;t all my name,&#8221; said the
	queer animal. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the story in
	the book? The monkey chased the cobbler&#8217;s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"></a>wife all around the steeple. That&#8217;s the way the
	money goes, Pop! goes the weasel. I&#8217;m Mr.
	Pop-Goes, the weasel, you see. I&#8217;m &#8216;specially
	good at chasing rabbits.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; barked Mr. Bigtail, the fox.
	&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be glad if you can help me get those
	rabbits. I&#8217;ve been over to that Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s
	hollow-stump bungalow, but he isn&#8217;t around.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s visiting the Littletail rabbits,&#8221; said
	Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll drive
	him out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then Uncle Wiggily felt very badly, indeed,
	for he knew that a weasel is the worst animal a
	rabbit can have after him. Weasels are very
	fond of rabbits. They love them so much they
	want to eat them, and Uncle Wiggily did not
	want to be eaten, even by Mr. Pop-Goes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;What can I do
	to scare away the bad fox and Mr. Pop-Goes, the
	weasel? Oh, dear!&#8221; Then he thought of the
	toy balloons, that made a noise like a gun when
	they were blown up and burst. &#8220;The very
	thing!&#8221; thought the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>Carefully, as he hid behind the stump, Uncle
	Wiggily took out one of the toy balloons. Carefully
	he blew it up, bigger and bigger and
	bigger, until, all at once:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"></a>&#8220;Bang!&#8221; exploded the toy balloon, even making
	Uncle Wiggily jump. And as for the fox
	and Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel, why they were
	so kerslostrated (if you will kindly excuse me for
	using such a word) that they turned a somersault,
	jumped up in the air, came down, turned
	a peppersault, and started to run.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did you hear that noise?&#8221; asked the weasel.
	&#8220;That was a pop, and whenever I hear a pop I
	have to go! And I&#8217;m going fast!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So am I!&#8221; barked the fox. &#8220;That was a
	hunter with a gun after us, I guess. We&#8217;ll get
	those rabbits some other time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe you will, and maybe not!&#8221; laughed
	Uncle Wiggily, as he hurried on to the burrow
	with the bread, sugar and the rest of the toy balloons,
	with which Sammie and Susie had lots
	of fun.</p>

	<p>So you see Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel, didn&#8217;t
	get Uncle Wiggily after all, and if the pepper
	caster doesn&#8217;t throw dust in the potato&#8217;s eyes,
	and make it sneeze at the rag doll, I&#8217;ll tell you
	next about Uncle Wiggily and Simple Simon.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND SIMPLE SIMON</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">There!</span>&#8221; exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, who,
	with Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
	was visiting at the Littletail rabbit burrow
	one day. &#8220;There they are, Uncle Wiggily,
	all nicely wrapped up for you to carry.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s nicely wrapped up?&#8221; asked the
	bunny uncle. &#8220;And what do you want me to
	carry?&#8221; And he looked over the tops of his
	spectacles at the muskrat lady, sort of surprised
	and wondering.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want you to carry the jam tarts, and they
	are all nicely wrapped up,&#8221; went on Nurse Jane.
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember, I said I was going to
	make some for you to take over to Mrs. Wibblewobble,
	the duck lady?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;The jam tarts are for Lulu, Alice and Jimmie
	Wibblewobble, the duck children. I remember
	now. I&#8217;ll take them right over.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"></a>&#8220;They are all nicely wrapped up in a clean
	napkin,&#8221; went on the muskrat lady, &#8220;so be careful
	not to squash them and squeeze out the jam,
	as they are very fresh.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; promised the old rabbit gentleman,
	as he put on his fur coat and took down
	off the parlor mantle his red, white and blue
	striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch, made of
	a corn-stalk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, wait a minute, Uncle Wiggily! Wait
	a minute!&#8221; cried Mrs. Littletail, the bunny
	mother of Sammie and Susie, the rabbit children,
	as Mr. Longears started out. &#8220;Where are
	you going?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Over to Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady&#8217;s
	house, with some jam tarts for Lulu, Alice and
	Jimmie,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then would you mind carrying, also, this
	little rubber plant over to her?&#8221; asked Mrs. Littletail.
	&#8220;I told Mrs. Wibblewobble I would
	send one to her the first chance I had.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Right gladly will I take it,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	So Mrs. Littletail, the rabbit lady, wrapped
	the pot of the little rubber plant, with its thick,
	shiny green leaves, in a piece of paper, and Uncle
	Wiggily, tucking it under one paw, while with
	the other he leaned on his crutch, started off
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"></a>over the fields and through the woods, with the
	jam tarts in his pocket. Over toward the home
	of the Wibblewobble duck family he hopped.</p>

	<p>Mr. Longears, the nice old rabbit gentleman,
	had not gone very far before, all at once, from
	behind a snow-covered stump, he heard a voice
	saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I know I&#8217;ll never find him! I&#8217;ve
	looked all over and I can&#8217;t see him anywhere.
	Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My! That sounds like some one in trouble,&#8221;
	Uncle Wiggily said to himself. &#8220;I wonder if
	that is any of my little animal friends? I must
	look.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the rabbit gentleman peeked over the top
	of the stump, and there he saw a queer-looking
	boy, with a funny smile on his face, which was
	as round and shiny as the bottom of a new dish
	pan. And the boy looked so kind that Uncle
	Wiggily knew he would not hurt even a lollypop,
	much less a rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, hello!&#8221; cried the boy, as soon as he saw
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Longears,&#8221; replied the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;And who are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m Simple Simon,&#8221; was the answer.
	&#8220;I&#8217;m in the Mother Goose book, you know.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"></a>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;But you seem to be <i>out</i> of the book, just now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Simple Simon. &#8220;The page with
	my picture on it fell out of the book, and so I ran
	away. But I can&#8217;t find him anywhere and I
	don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who is it you can&#8217;t find?&#8221; asked the rabbit.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The pie-man,&#8221; answered the funny, round-faced
	boy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember, it says in
	the book, &#8216;Simple Simon met a pie-man going
	to the fair?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily answered.
	&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t find him anywhere,&#8221; said
	Simple Simon. &#8220;I guess the pie-man didn&#8217;t fall
	out of the book when I did.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily,
	kindly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Simple Simon. &#8220;For you know
	he ought to ask me for my penny, when I want
	to taste of his pies, and indeed, I haven&#8217;t any
	penny&#8212;not any, and I&#8217;m <i>so</i> hungry for a piece
	of pie!&#8221; And Simple Simon began to cry.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;See,
	in my pocket I have some jam tarts. They are
	for Lulu, Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the
	ducks, but there are enough to let you have one.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"></a>&#8220;Why, you are a regular pie-man yourself;
	aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; laughed Simple Simon, as he ate
	one of Nurse Jane&#8217;s nice jam tarts.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you might call me that,&#8221; said the
	bunny uncle. &#8220;Though I s&#8217;pose a tart-man
	would be nearer right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s something else,&#8221; went on Simple
	Simon. &#8220;You know in the Mother Goose book
	I have to go for water, in my mother&#8217;s sieve. But
	soon it all ran through.&#8221; And then, cried
	Simple Simon, &#8220;Oh, dear, what shall I do?&#8221;
	And he held out a sieve, just like a coffee
	strainer, full of little holes. &#8220;How can I ever
	get water in that?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried and
	tried, but I can&#8217;t. No one can! It all runs
	through!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then
	he cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have it! I&#8217;ll pull some leaves off the rubber
	plant I am taking to Mrs. Wibblewobble.
	We&#8217;ll put the leaves in the bottom of the sieve,
	and, being of rubber, water can&#8217;t get through
	them. Then the sieve will hold water, or milk
	either, and you can bring it to your mother.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, fine!&#8221; cried Simple Simon, licking the
	sticky squeegee jam off his fingers. So Uncle
	Wiggily put some rubber plant leaves in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"></a>bottom of the sieve, and Simple Simon, filling it
	full of water, carried it home to his mother, and
	not a drop ran through, which, of course, wasn&#8217;t
	at all like the story in the book.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	as he took the rest of the jam tarts to the
	Wibblewobble children. &#8220;I just had to help
	Simple Simon.&#8221; Which was very kind of Uncle
	Wiggily, I think; don&#8217;t you? It didn&#8217;t matter if,
	just once, something happened that wasn&#8217;t in the
	book.</p>

	<p>And Mrs. Wibblewobble didn&#8217;t at all mind
	some of the leaves being off her rubber plant.
	So you see we should always be kind when we
	can; and if the canary bird doesn&#8217;t go to sleep
	in the bowl with the goldfish, and forget to
	whistle like an alarm clock in the morning, I&#8217;ll
	tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
	crumple-horn cow.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CRUMPLE-HORN COW</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Where</span> are you going, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221;
	asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit gentleman
	starting out from his hollow-stump bungalow
	one day. He was back again from his visit
	to Sammie and Susie Littletail.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m just going for a walk,&#8221; answered
	Mr. Longears. &#8220;I have not had an exciting adventure
	since I carried the valentines for Jack
	and Jill, before they tumbled down hill, and
	perhaps to-day I may find something else to
	make me lively, and happy and skippy like.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Too much hopping and skipping is not
	good for you,&#8221; the muskrat lady said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it is, if you will excuse me for
	saying so,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily politely. &#8220;It
	keeps my rheumatism from getting too painful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then, taking his red, white and blue striped
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"></a>rheumatism crutch from inside the talking machine
	horn, Uncle Wiggily started off.</p>

	<p>Over the fields and through the woods went
	the rabbit gentleman, until, pretty soon, as he
	was walking along, wondering what would happen
	to him that day, he heard a voice saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Moo! Moo! Moo-o-o-o-o!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah! That sounds rather sad and unhappy
	like,&#8221; spoke the rabbit gentleman to himself.
	&#8220;I wonder if it can be any one in trouble?&#8221;</p>

	<p>So he peeked through the bushes and there he
	saw a nice cow, who was standing with one foot
	in the hollow of a big stump.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Moo! Moo!&#8221; cried the cow. &#8220;Oh, dear,
	will no one help me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, of course, I&#8217;ll help you,&#8221; kindly said
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;What is the matter, and who
	are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I am the Mother Goose cow with the
	crumpled horn,&#8221; was the answer, &#8220;and my foot
	is caught so tightly in the hole of this stump that
	I cannot get it out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll help you, Mrs. Crumpled-horn
	Cow,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, kindly. Then, with
	his rheumatism crutch, the rabbit gentleman
	pushed loose the cow&#8217;s hoof from where it was
	caught in the stump, and she was all right again.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"></a>&#8220;Oh, thank you so much, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221;
	spoke the crumpled-horn cow. &#8220;If ever I can
	do you a favor I will.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman, politely.
	&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will. But how did you
	happen to get your hoof caught in that stump?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I was standing on it, trying to see if I
	could jump over the moon,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Jump over the moon!&#8221; cried the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;You surprise me! Why in the
	<span class="keep_together">world&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, you see,&#8221; spoke the crumpled-horn
	lady cow. &#8220;In the Mother Goose book it
	says: &#8216;Hi-diddle-diddle, the cat&#8217;s in the fiddle,
	the cow jumped over the moon.&#8217; Well, if one
	cow did that, I don&#8217;t see why another one can&#8217;t.
	I got up on the stump, to try and jump over the
	moon, but my foot slipped and I was caught fast.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I suppose I should not have tried it, for I
	am the cow with the crumpled horn. You have
	heard of me, I dare say. I&#8217;m the cow with the
	crumpled horn, that little Boy Blue drove out
	of the corn. I tossed the dog that worried that
	cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay
	in the house that Jack built.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember you now,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"></a>&#8220;And this is my crumpled horn,&#8221; went on the
	cow, and she showed the rabbit gentleman how
	one of her horns was all crumpled and crooked
	and twisted, just like a corkscrew that is used
	to pull hard corks out of bottles.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, thank you again for pulling out my
	foot,&#8221; said the cow, as she turned away. &#8220;Now
	I must go toss that dog once more, for he&#8217;s always
	worrying the cat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the cow went away, and Uncle Wiggily
	hopped on through the woods and over the
	fields. He had had an adventure, you see, helping
	the cow, and later on he had another one,
	for he met Jimmie Wibblewobble, the boy duck,
	who had lost his penny going to the store for a
	cornmeal-flavored lollypop. Uncle Wiggily
	found the penny in the snow, and Jimmie was
	happy once more.</p>

	<p>The next day when Uncle Wiggily awakened
	in his hollow-stump bungalow, and tried to get
	out of bed, he was so lame and stiff that he could
	hardly move.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; cried the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;Ouch! Oh, what a pain!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane. &#8220;What&#8217;s
	the matter?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My rheumatism,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"></a>&#8220;Please send to Dr. Possum and get some
	medicine. Ouch! Oh, my!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go for the medicine myself,&#8221; Nurse Jane
	said, and, tying her tail up in a double bow-knot,
	so she would not step on it, and trip, as she hurried
	along, over to Dr. Possum&#8217;s she went.</p>

	<p>The doctor was just starting out to go to see
	Nannie Wagtail, the little goat girl, who had
	the hornache, but before going there Dr. Possum
	ran back into his office, got a big bottle of
	medicine, which he gave to Nurse Jane, saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;When you get back to the hollow-stump
	bungalow pull out the cork and rub some on
	Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s pain.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Rub the cork on?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane, sort
	of surprised like.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, rub on some of the medicine from the
	bottle,&#8221; answered Dr. Possum, laughing as he
	hurried off.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily had a bad pain when Nurse
	Jane got back.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon fix you,&#8221; said the muskrat lady.
	&#8220;Wait until I get the cork out of this bottle.&#8221;
	But that was more easily said than done. Nurse
	Jane tried with all her might to pull out the cork
	with her paws and even with her teeth. Then
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"></a>she used a hair pin, but it only bent and twisted
	itself all up in a knot.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, hurry with the medicine!&#8221; begged
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Hurry, please!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get the cork out,&#8221; said Nurse Jane.
	&#8220;The cork is stuck in the bottle.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; spoke the bunny uncle. But
	he could not get the cork out, either, and his pain
	was getting worse all the while.</p>

	<p>Just then came a knock on the bungalow
	door, and a voice said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am the cow with the crumpled horn. I
	just met Dr. Possum, and he told me Uncle Wiggily
	had the rheumatism. Is there anything I
	can do for him? I&#8217;d like to do him a favor as
	he did me one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, you can help me,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;Can you pull a tight cork out of a
	bottle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed I can!&#8221; mooed the cow. &#8220;Just
	watch me!&#8221; She put her crooked, crumpled
	horn, which was just like a corkscrew, in the
	cork, and, with one twist, out it came from the
	bottle as easily as anything. Then Nurse Jane
	could rub some medicine on Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s
	rheumatism, which soon felt much better.</p>

	<p>So you see Mother Goose&#8217;s crumpled-horn
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"></a>cow can do other things besides tossing cat-worrying
	dogs. And if the fried egg doesn&#8217;t go
	to sleep in the dish pan, so the knives and forks
	can&#8217;t play tag there, I&#8217;ll tell you next of Uncle
	Wiggily and Old Mother Hubbard.</p>

<div id="chapter_15" class="chapter">

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND OLD MOTHER HUBBARD</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily</span>, have you anything special
	to do this morning?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper for the
	rabbit gentleman, as she saw him get up from
	the breakfast table in his hollow-stump bungalow.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Anything special? Why, no, I guess not,&#8221;
	answered the bunny uncle. &#8220;I was going out
	for a walk, and perhaps I may meet with an adventure
	on the way, or I may help some friends
	of Mother Goose, as I sometimes do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are always being kind to some one,&#8221;
	said Nurse Jane, &#8220;and that is what I want you
	to do now. I have just made an orange cake,
	<span class="keep_together">and&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;An orange cake?&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily,
	his pink nose twinkling. &#8220;How nice! Where
	did you get the oranges?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Up on the Orange Mountains, to be sure,&#8221;
	answered the muskrat lady, with a laugh. &#8220;I
	have made two orange cakes, to tell the exact
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"></a>truth, which I always do. There is one for us
	and I wanted to send one to Dr. Possum, who
	was so good to cure you of the rheumatism,
	when the cow with the crumpled horn pulled the
	hard cork out of the medicine bottle for us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Send an orange cake to Dr. Possum? The
	very thing! Oh, fine!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it right over to him. Put it in a basket,
	so it will not take cold, Nurse Jane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The muskrat lady wrapped the orange cake
	in a clean napkin, and then put it in the basket
	for Uncle Wiggily to carry to Dr. Possum.</p>

	<p>Off started the old rabbit gentleman, over the
	woods and through the fields&#8212;oh, excuse me
	just a minute. He did not go over the woods
	this time. He only did that when he had his
	airship, which he was not using to-day, for fear
	of spilling the oranges out of the cake. So he
	went over the fields and through the woods to
	Dr. Possum&#8217;s office.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I wonder if I will have any adventure
	to-day?&#8221; thought the old rabbit gentleman, as
	he hopped along. &#8220;I hope I do, <span class="keep_together">for&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>And then he suddenly stopped thinking and
	listened, for he heard a dog barking, and a
	voice was sadly saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! It&#8217;s too bad, I know it is, but I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"></a>can&#8217;t help it. It&#8217;s that way in the book, so you&#8217;ll
	have to go hungry.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the dog barked again and Uncle Wiggily
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;More trouble for some one. I hope it isn&#8217;t
	the bad dog who used to bother me. I wonder
	if I can help any one?&#8221;</p>

	<p>He looked around, and, nearby, he saw a
	little wooden house on the top of a hill. The
	barking and talking was coming from that
	house.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up and see what is the matter?&#8221; said
	the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;Perhaps I can help.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He looked through a window of the house
	before going in, and he saw a lady, somewhat
	like Mother Goose, wearing a tall, peaked hat,
	like an ice cream cone turned upside down.
	And with her was a big dog, who was looking
	in an open cupboard and barking. And the
	lady was singing:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Old Mother Hubbard</p>
		<p>Went to the cupboard</p>
		<p class="i2">To get her poor dog a bone.</p>
		<p>But, when she got there,</p>
		<p>The cupboard was bare,</p>
		<p class="i2">And so the poor dog had none.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"></a>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t there anything else in the house
	to eat, except a bone, Mother Hubbard?&#8221; the
	dog asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sorry to say,&#8221; she answered.
	&#8220;But I&#8217;ll go to the baker&#8217;s to get you some
	<span class="keep_together">bread&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And when you come back you will think I
	am dead,&#8221; said the dog, quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look so,
	anyhow,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;for I am so hungry.
	Isn&#8217;t there any way of getting me anything to
	eat without going to the baker&#8217;s? I don&#8217;t care
	much for bread, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How would you like a piece of orange
	cake?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily, all of a sudden,
	as he walked in Mother Hubbard&#8217;s house. &#8220;Excuse
	me,&#8221; said the bunny uncle, &#8220;but I could
	not help hearing what your dog said. I know
	how hard it is to be hungry, and I have an
	orange cake in my basket. It is for Dr. Possum,
	but I am sure he would be glad to let your dog
	have some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is very kind of you,&#8221; said Mother
	Hubbard.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And I certainly would like orange cake,&#8221;
	spoke the dog, making a bow and wagging his
	nose&#8212;I mean his tail.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then you shall have it,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"></a>opening the basket. He set the orange
	cake on the table, and the dog began to eat it,
	and Mother Hubbard also ate some, for she was
	hungry, too, and, what do you think? Before
	Uncle Wiggily, or any one else knew it, the
	orange cake was all gone&#8212;eaten up&#8212;and there
	was none for Dr. Possum.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, see what we have done!&#8221; cried Mother
	Hubbard, sadly. &#8220;We have eaten all your
	cake, Uncle Wiggily. I&#8217;m sure we did not mean
	to, but with a hungry <span class="keep_together">dog&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray do not mention it,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman,
	politely. &#8220;I know just how it is. I have
	another orange cake of my own at home. I&#8217;ll
	go get that for Dr. Possum. He won&#8217;t mind
	which one he has.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t let you do that,&#8221; spoke Mother
	Hubbard. &#8220;You were too kind to be put to all
	that trouble. Next door to me lives Paddy
	Kake, the baker-man. I&#8217;ll have him bake you
	a cake as fast as he can, and you can take that
	to Dr. Possum. How will that do?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, that will be just fine!&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose at the dog, who
	was licking up the last of the cake crumbs with
	his red tongue.</p>

	<p>So Mother Hubbard went next door, where
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"></a>lived Paddy Kake, the baker. And she said to
	him:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Paddy Kake, Paddy Kake, baker-man,</p>
		<p>Bake me a cake as fast as you can.</p>
		<p>Into it please put a raisin and plum,</p>
		<p>And mark it with D. P. for Dr. Possum.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Paddy Kake. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it right
	away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And he did, and as soon as the cake was
	baked Uncle Wiggily put it in the basket where
	the orange one had been, and took it to Dr. Possum,
	who was very glad to get it. For the raisin
	and plum cake was as good as the orange one
	Mother Hubbard and her dog had eaten.</p>

	<p>So you see everything came out all right after
	all, and if the cork doesn&#8217;t pop out of the ink
	bottle and go to sleep in the middle of the white
	bedspread, like our black cat, I&#8217;ll tell you next
	about Uncle Wiggily and Little Miss Muffet.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND MISS MUFFET</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Rat-a-tat-tat</span>!&#8221; came a knock on the door
	of the hollow-stump bungalow, where Uncle
	Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, lived
	with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper. &#8220;Rat-a-tat-tat!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; called Nurse Jane, who was sitting
	by a window, mending a pair of Uncle
	Wiggily&#8217;s socks, which had holes in them.</p>

	<p>The door opened, and into the bungalow
	stepped a little girl. Oh, she was such a tiny
	thing that she was not much larger than a doll.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How do you do, Nurse Jane,&#8221; said the little
	girl, making a low bow, and shaking her curly
	hair.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I am very well, thank you,&#8221; the muskrat
	lady said. &#8220;How are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m very well, too, Nurse Jane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! You seem to know me, but I am not
	so sure I know you,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s
	housekeeper. &#8220;Are you Little Bo Peep?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"></a>&#8220;No, Nurse Jane,&#8221; answered the little girl,
	with a smile.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you Mistress Mary, quite contrary, how
	does your garden grow?&#8221; Nurse Jane wanted
	to know.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am not Mistress Mary,&#8221; answered the little
	girl.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then who are you?&#8221; Nurse Jane asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am little Miss Muffet, if you please, and I
	have come to sit on a tuffet, and eat some curds
	and whey. I want to see Uncle Wiggily, too, before
	I go away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; spoke Nurse Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you
	the tuffet and the curds and whey,&#8221; and she went
	out to the kitchen. The muskrat lady noticed
	that Miss Muffet said nothing about the spider
	frightening her away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Perhaps she doesn&#8217;t like to talk about it,&#8221;
	thought Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, &#8220;though it&#8217;s in the
	Mother Goose book. Well, I&#8217;ll not say anything,
	either.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So she got the tuffet for little Miss Muffet; a
	tuffet being a sort of baby footstool. And, indeed,
	the little girl had to sit on something quite
	small, for her legs were very short.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And here are your curds and whey,&#8221; went
	on Nurse Jane, bringing in a bowl. Curds and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"></a>whey are very good to eat. They are made from
	milk, sweetened, and are something like a custard
	in a cup.</p>

	<p>So little Miss Muffet, sat on a tuffet, eating
	her curds and whey, just as she ought to have
	done.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Nurse Jane to herself, &#8220;I do
	hope no spider will come sit beside her to
	frighten Miss Muffet away, before Uncle Wiggily
	sees her, for she is a dear little child.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Pretty soon some one was heard hopping up
	the front steps of the bungalow, and Nurse Jane
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;There is Uncle Wiggily now, I think.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad!&#8221; exclaimed little Miss Muffet,
	as she handed the muskrat lady the empty
	bowl of curds and whey. &#8220;I want to see him
	very specially.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In came hopping the nice old rabbit gentleman,
	and he knew Little Miss Muffet right
	away, and was very glad to see her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; cried the little girl.
	&#8220;I have been waiting to see you. I want you to
	do me a very special extra favor; will you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, of course, if I can,&#8221; answered the
	bunny uncle, with a polite bow. &#8220;I am always
	glad to do favors.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"></a>&#8220;You can easily do this one,&#8221; said Little Miss
	Muffet. &#8220;I want you to <span class="keep_together">come&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>And just then Uncle Wiggily saw a big spider
	crawling over the floor toward the little girl, who
	was still on her tuffet, having finished her curds
	and whey.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And if she sees that spider, sit down beside
	her, it surely will frighten her away,&#8221; thought
	Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;and I will not be able to find
	out what she wants me to do for her. Let me
	see, she hasn&#8217;t yet noticed the spider. I wonder
	if I could get her out of the room while I asked
	the spider to kindly not to do any frightening,
	at least for a while?&#8221;</p>

	<p>So Uncle Wiggily, who was quite worried,
	sort of waved his paw sideways at the spider, and
	twinkled his pink nose and said &#8220;Ahem!&#8221;
	which meant that the spider was to keep on
	crawling, and not go near Miss Muffet. Uncle
	Wiggily himself was not afraid of spiders.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; went on little Miss
	Muffet, who had not yet seen the spider. &#8220;I
	want you to come <span class="keep_together">to&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221; and then she saw the
	rabbit gentleman making funny noses behind
	her back, and waving his paw at something, and
	Miss Muffet cried:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"></a>&#8220;Why, what in the world is the matter, Uncle
	Wiggily? Have you hurt yourself?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the rabbit gentleman quickly exclaimed.
	&#8220;It&#8217;s the spider. She&#8217;s crawling toward
	you, and I don&#8217;t want her to sit down beside
	you, and frighten you away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Little Miss Muffet laughed a jolly laugh.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
	at all afraid of spiders! I&#8217;d let a dozen of them
	sit beside me if they wanted to, for I know they
	will not harm me, if I do not harm them. And
	besides, I knew this spider was coming all the
	while.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; cried Nurse Jane, surprised like.</p>

	<p>&#8220;To be sure I did. She is Mrs. Spin-Spider,
	and she has come to measure me for a new cobweb
	silk dress; haven&#8217;t you, Mrs. Spin-Spider?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, child, I have,&#8221; answered the lady spider.
	&#8220;No one need be afraid of me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said, &#8220;only I did
	not want you to frighten Miss Muffet away before
	she had her curds and whey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I had them,&#8221; the little girl said. &#8220;Nurse
	Jane gave them to me before you came in, Uncle
	Wiggily. But now let me tell you what I came
	for, and then Mrs. Spin-Spider can measure me
	for a new dress. I came to ask if you would do
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"></a>me the favor to come to my birthday party next
	week. Will you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course I will!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;I&#8217;ll be delighted.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; laughed Little Miss Muffet. Then
	along came Mrs. Spin-Spider, and sat down beside
	her and did not frighten the little girl away,
	but, instead, measured her for a new dress.</p>

	<p>So from this we may learn that cobwebs are
	good for something else than catching flies, and
	in the next chapter, if the piano doesn&#8217;t come upstairs
	to lie down on the brass bed so the pillow
	has to go down in the coal bin to sleep, I&#8217;ll tell
	you about Uncle Wiggily and the first little kitten.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FIRST KITTEN</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
	gentleman, was asleep in his easy chair by
	the fire which burned brightly on the hearth in
	his hollow-stump bungalow. Mr. Longears
	was dreaming that he had just eaten a piece of
	cherry pie for lunch, and that the cherry pits
	were dropping on the floor with a &#8220;rat-a-tat-tat!&#8221;
	when he suddenly awakened and heard
	some one knocking on the front door.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Who is there? Come in!&#8221; cried the
	rabbit gentleman, hardly awake yet. Then he
	happened to think:</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope it isn&#8217;t the bad fox, or the skillery-scalery
	alligator, whom I have invited in. I
	ought not to have been so quick.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But it was none of these unpleasant creatures
	who had knocked on Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s door. It
	was Mrs. Purr, the nice cat lady, and when the
	rabbit gentleman had let her in she looked so sad
	and sorrowful that he said:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"></a>&#8220;What is the matter, Mrs. Purr? Has anything
	happened?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed there has, Mr. Longears,&#8221; the cat
	lady answered. &#8220;You know my three little kittens,
	don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I know them,&#8221; replied the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;They are Fuzzo, Muzzo and Wuzzo.
	I hope they are not ill?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, they are not ill,&#8221; said the cat lady, mewing
	sadly, &#8220;but they have run away, and I came
	to see if you would help me get them back.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Run away! Your dear little kittens!&#8221; cried
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it! How
	did it happen?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you know my little kittens had each a
	new pair of mittens,&#8221; said Mrs. Purr.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I read about that in the Mother Goose
	book,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;It must be
	nice to have new mittens.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My little kittens thought so,&#8221; went on Mrs.
	Purr. &#8220;Their grandmother, Pussy Cat Mole,
	knitted them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have met Pussy Cat Mole,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;After she jumped over a coal, and
	in her best petticoat burned a great hole, I helped
	her mend it so she could go to the party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I heard about that; it was very good of you,&#8221;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"></a>mewed Mrs. Purr. &#8220;But about my little kittens,
	when they got their mittens, what do you think
	they did?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose they went out and played in
	the snow,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said. &#8220;I know that
	is what I would have done, when I was a little
	rabbit, if I had had a new pair of mittens.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I only wish they had done that,&#8221; Mrs. Purr
	said. &#8220;But, instead, they went and ate some
	cherry pie. The red pie-juice got all over their
	new mittens, and when they saw it they became
	afraid I would scold them, and they ran away.
	I was not home when they ate the pie and soiled
	their mittens, but the cat lady who lives next door
	told me.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now I want to know if you will try to find
	my three little kittens for me; Fuzzo, Wuzzo
	and Muzzo? I want them to come home so
	badly!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go look for them,&#8221; promised the old rabbit
	gentleman. So taking his red, white and blue
	rheumatism crutch, off he started over the fields
	and through the woods. Mrs. Purr went back
	home to get supper, in case her kittens, with
	their pie-soiled mittens, should come back by
	themselves before Uncle Wiggily found them.</p>

	<p>On and on went the old rabbit gentleman.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"></a>He looked on all sides and through the middle
	for any signs of the lost kittens, but he saw none
	for quite a while. Then, all at once, he heard a
	mewing sound over in the bushes, and he said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! There is the first little kitten!&#8221; And
	there, surely enough she was&#8212;Fuzzo!</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; Fuzzo was saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
	I&#8217;ll ever get them clean!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; asked the rabbit
	gentleman, though he knew quite well what it
	was, and only pretended he did not. &#8220;Who are
	you and what is the matter?&#8221; he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in such trouble,&#8221; said the first little
	kitten. &#8220;My sisters and I ate some pie in our
	new mittens. We soiled them badly with the
	red pie-juice. Weren&#8217;t we naughty kittens?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps just a little bit naughty,&#8221;
	Uncle Wiggily said. &#8220;But you should not have
	run away from your mamma. She feels very
	badly. Where are Muzzo and Wuzzo?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; answered Fuzzo. &#8220;They
	ran one way and I ran another. I&#8217;m trying to
	get the pie-juice out of my mittens, but I can&#8217;t
	seem to do it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How did you try?&#8221; Uncle Wiggily wanted
	to know.</p>

	<div class="illo">
		<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"></a>
		<img src="images/fig128.jpg" width="500" height="743" alt="Uncle Wiggily meets a sad kitten sitting on a rock." />
		<p class="caption">&#8220;Weren&#8217;t we naughty kittens?&#8221;</p>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"></a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;I am rubbing my mittens up and down on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"></a>the rough bark of trees and on stones,&#8221; answered
	Fuzzo. &#8220;I thought that would take the pie
	stains out, but it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; laughed Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Now you come with me. I am going to take
	you home. Your mother sent me to look for
	you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, but I&#8217;m afraid to go home,&#8221; mewed
	Fuzzo. &#8220;My mother will scold me for soiling
	my nice, new mittens. It says so in the book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, she won&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;You just leave it to me. But first you come
	to my hollow-stump bungalow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So Fuzzo, the first little kitten, put one paw
	in Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s, and carrying her mittens
	in the other, along they went together.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are you, Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy?&#8221; called the rabbit gentleman, when
	they reached his hollow-stump bungalow. &#8220;I
	want you to make some nice, hot, soapy suds and
	water, and wash this first little kitten&#8217;s mittens.
	Then they will be clean, and she can take them
	home with her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the muskrat lady made some nice, hot, soap-bubbily
	suds and in them she washed the kitten&#8217;s
	mittens. Then, when they were dry, Uncle Wiggily
	<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"></a>took the mittens, and also Fuzzo to Mrs.
	Purr&#8217;s house.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, how glad I am to have you back!&#8221; cried
	the cat mother. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have scolded you,
	Fuzzo, for soiling your mittens. You must not
	be afraid any more.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised the first little kitten,
	showing her nice, clean mittens.</p>

	<p>And then Uncle Wiggily said he would go
	find the other two lost baby cats. And so, if the
	milkman doesn&#8217;t put goldfish in the ink bottle,
	to make the puppy dog laugh when he goes to
	bed, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
	the second kittie.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SECOND KITTEN</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Well</span>, where are you going now, Uncle
	Wiggily?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
	the muskrat lady housekeeper, of the rabbit gentleman,
	one day as she saw him starting out of
	his hollow-stump bungalow, after he had found
	the first of the little kittens who had soiled their
	mittens.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am going to look for the second little lost
	kitten,&#8221; replied the bunny uncle, &#8220;though where
	she may be I don&#8217;t know. Her name is Muzzo.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, her name is almost like mine, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
	asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A little like it,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Poor
	little Muzzo! She and the other two kittens ran
	off after they had soiled their mittens, eating
	cherry pie when their mother, Mrs. Purr, was
	not at home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is very good of you to go looking for
	them,&#8221; said Nurse Jane.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"></a>&#8220;Oh, I just love to do things like that,&#8221; spoke
	the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;Well, good-by. I&#8217;ll see
	if I can&#8217;t find the second kitten now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Away started the rabbit gentleman, over the
	fields and through the woods, looking on all
	sides for the second lost kitten, whose name was
	Muzzo.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are you, kittie?&#8221; called Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Where are you, Muzzo? Come to me!
	Never mind if your mittens are soiled by cherry-pie-juice.
	I&#8217;ll find a way to clean them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But no Muzzo answered. Uncle Wiggily
	looked everywhere, under bushes and in the tree
	tops; for sometimes kitty cats climb trees, you
	know; but no Muzzo could he find. Then
	Uncle Wiggily walked a little farther, and he
	saw Billie Wagtail, the goat boy, butting his
	head in a snow-bank.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Billie?&#8221; asked the rabbit
	gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, just having some fun,&#8221; answered Billie,
	standing up on his hind legs.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen a little lost kitten, with
	cherry-pie-juice on her new mittens, have you?&#8221;
	asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I am sorry to say I have not,&#8221; said Billie,
	politely. &#8220;Did you lose one?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"></a>&#8220;No, she lost herself,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	and he told about Muzzo.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you look for her,&#8221; offered the goat
	boy, so he and Uncle Wiggily started off together
	to try to find poor little lost Muzzo, and
	bring her home to her mother, Mrs. Purr.</p>

	<p>Pretty soon, as the rabbit gentleman and the
	goat boy were walking along they heard a little
	mewing cry behind a pile of snow, and Uncle
	Wiggily said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;That sounds like Muzzo now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is. Let&#8217;s look,&#8221; said Billie Wagtail.</p>

	<p>He and the bunny uncle looked over the pile
	of snow, and there, surely enough, they saw a
	little white pussy cat sitting on a stone, looking
	at her mittens, which were all covered with red
	pie-juice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; the little pussy was saying.
	&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to get them clean! What
	shall I do? I can&#8217;t go home with my mittens all
	soiled, or my mamma will whip me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Of course, Mrs. Purr, the cat lady, would not
	do anything like that, but Muzzo thought she
	would.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do to clean your
	mittens, Muzzo?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"></a>&#8220;Oh, how you surprised me!&#8221; exclaimed the
	second little lost kitten. &#8220;I did not know you
	were here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Billie Wagtail and I came to look for you,&#8221;
	said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;But what about your
	mittens?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I have been dipping them in snow, trying
	to clean them,&#8221; said Muzzo. &#8220;Only the
	pie-juice will not come out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily, with
	a laugh. &#8220;It needs hot soap-suds and water to
	clean them. You come home to my bungalow
	and we will get some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so cold and tired I can&#8217;t go another
	step,&#8221; said the second little kitten, who had run
	away from home after she soiled her mittens.
	&#8220;I just can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, then, I don&#8217;t know how you are going
	to get your mittens washed, out here in the cold
	and snow,&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! I know a way!&#8221; said Billie Wagtail,
	the goat boy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get an empty tomato can,&#8221; spoke Billie.
	&#8220;I know where there is one, for I was eating
	the paper off it, to get the paste, just before you
	came along.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"></a>Goats like to eat paper off tomato cans, you
	know, because the paper is stuck on with sweet
	paste, and that is as good to goat children as
	candy is to you.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go get the tomato can,&#8221; said Billie, &#8220;and
	you can make a fire, Uncle Wiggily.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And then what?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then we will melt some snow, and make
	some hot water,&#8221; went on Billie. &#8220;I have a cake
	of soap in my pocket, that I just bought at the
	store for my mother.</p>

	<p>&#8220;With the hot water in the can, and the soap,
	we can make a suds, and wash Muzzo&#8217;s mittens
	out here as well as at your bungalow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So we can, Billie!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;You go get the empty tomato tin and I&#8217;ll make
	the fire. You needn&#8217;t try to wash your soiled
	mittens in the snow any more, Muzzo,&#8221; he said
	to the second lost kittie. &#8220;We will do it for you,
	in soapy water, which is better.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Soon Uncle Wiggily made a fire. Back came
	Billie Wagtail with the tomato can. Some snow
	was put in it, and it was set over the blaze. Soon
	the snow melted into water, and then when the
	water was hot Uncle Wiggily made a soapy suds
	as Nurse Jane had done.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"></a>&#8220;Now I can wash my mittens!&#8221; cried Muzzo,
	and she did. And when they were nice and
	clean she went home with them, and oh! how
	glad her mother was to see her!</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never run away again, Muzzo,&#8221; said the
	cat lady.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised the kitten. &#8220;But where
	is Wuzzo?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She is still lost,&#8221; said Mrs. Purr.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I will go find her, too,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily.</p>

	<p>And if the apple pie doesn&#8217;t go out snowballing
	with the piece of cheese, and forget to come
	back to dinner, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle
	Wiggily and the third little kitten.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE THIRD KITTEN</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old
	gentleman rabbit, came walking slowly up the
	front path that led to his hollow-stump bungalow.
	He was limping a little on his red, white
	and blue striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch
	that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper, had gnawed for him out of a
	corn-stalk.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to be home again,&#8221; said the
	rabbit uncle, sitting down on the front porch to
	rest a minute. And just then the door in the
	hollow stump opened, and Nurse Jane, looking
	out, said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, here he is now, Mrs. Purr.&#8221;</p>

	<p>With that a cat lady came to the door and she
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily! I thought you never
	would come back. Did you find her?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Find who?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman.
	&#8220;I was not looking for any one. I have just
	<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"></a>been down to Lincoln Park to see some squirrels
	who live in a hollow tree. They are second
	cousins to Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the
	squirrels who live in our woods. I had a nice
	visit with them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t find Wuzzo, my third little
	lost kitten, did you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Purr, the cat
	mother.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What! Is Wuzzo still lost?&#8221; asked the
	bunny uncle, in great surprise. &#8220;I thought she
	had come home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, she hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Purr. &#8220;You
	know you found my other kittens, Fuzzo
	and Muzzo, for me, but Wuzzo, the third little
	kitten, is still lost. She has been away all night,
	and I came over here the first thing this morning
	to see if you would not kindly go look for her.
	But you had already left and I have been waiting
	here ever since for you to come back.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I stayed longer with the park squirrels
	than I meant to,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;But
	now I am back I will start off and try to find
	Wuzzo. It&#8217;s too bad your three little kittens ran
	away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>They had, you know, as I told you in the two
	stories before this one. The three little kittens
	ate cherry pie with their new mittens on. And
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"></a>they soiled their mittens. Then they were so
	afraid their mother, Mrs. Purr, would scold
	them that they all ran away.</p>

	<p>But Mrs. Purr was a kind cat, and would not
	have scolded at all. And when she found her
	little kittens were gone she asked Uncle Wiggily
	to find them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you did find the first two, Fuzzo and
	Muzzo,&#8221; said the cat lady. &#8220;So I am sure you
	can find the third one, Wuzzo.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hope I can,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said. &#8220;I remember
	now I started off to find her, but my
	rheumatism hurt me so I had to come back to
	my bungalow. Then I forgot all about Wuzzo.
	But I&#8217;m all right now, and I&#8217;ll start off.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So away over the fields and through the woods
	went Uncle Wiggily, looking for the third little
	lost kitten. When he had found the two others
	he had helped them wash the pie-juice off their
	mittens, so they were nice and clean. And then
	the kittens were not afraid to go home.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily looked all over for the third
	little kitten, under bushes, up in trees (for cats
	climb trees, you know), and even behind big
	rocks Uncle Wiggily looked. But no Wuzzo
	could he find.</p>

	<p>At last, when the rabbit gentleman came to a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"></a>big hollow log that was lying on the ground, he
	sat down on it to rest, and, all of a sudden, he
	heard a voice inside the log speaking. And the
	voice asked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to London to see the Queen,&#8221; answered
	another voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you do
	there?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I frightened a little mouse, under her chair,&#8221;
	came the answer, and this time it was a little
	pussy cat kitten speaking, Uncle Wiggily was
	certain.</p>

	<p>The old rabbit gentleman looked in one end
	of the hollow log, and there surely enough, he
	saw Wuzzo, the third lost kitten.</p>

	<p>And besides Wuzzo, Uncle Wiggily saw
	Neddie Stubtail, the little bear boy, who always
	slept in a hollow log all Winter. But this time
	Neddie was awake, for it was near Spring.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wuzzo, Wuzzo! Is that you? What are
	you doing there?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know your poor mother is looking
	all over for you, and that she has sent me to
	find you? Why don&#8217;t you come home?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I&#8217;m afraid to,&#8221; said Wuzzo, crawling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"></a>out of the hollow log, and Neddie, the boy bear
	also crawled out, saying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How do you do, Neddie,&#8221; spoke the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;How long has Wuzzo been staying
	with you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She just ran in my hollow log,&#8221; said the little
	bear chap, &#8220;and her tail, brushing against my
	nose, tickled me so that I sneezed and awakened
	from my Winter sleep.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where have you been all night, since you
	ran away, Wuzzo?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the third little kitten.
	&#8220;After Fuzzo, Muzzo and I soiled our mittens
	with cherry pie we all ran away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that part,&#8221; spoke the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;It was not right to do, but I have found
	the two other lost kitties. I couldn&#8217;t find you,
	though. Why was that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because I met Mother Goose,&#8221; said Wuzzo,
	&#8220;and she asked me to go to London to see the
	Queen. She took me through the air on the
	back of her big gander, and we flew as quickly
	as you could have gone in your airship.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You went to London to see the Queen!&#8221; exclaimed
	Uncle Wiggily, in surprise. &#8220;Well,
	well! What did you do there?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"></a>&#8220;I frightened a little mouse under her chair,
	just as Mother Goose wanted me to do,&#8221; said
	Wuzzo. &#8220;Then the big gander flew with me to
	these woods and went back to get Mother Goose,
	who stayed to talk with the Queen. So here I
	am, but I don&#8217;t know the way home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take you home all right,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;But first we must wash your mittens.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I did that for her, in the log,&#8221; said Neddie
	Stubtail, laughing. &#8220;With my red tongue
	I licked off all the sweet cherry-pie-juice, which
	I liked very much. So, now the mittens are
	clean.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle. &#8220;Now we
	will go to your mother, Wuzzo. She will be
	glad to know that you frightened a little mouse
	under the Queen&#8217;s chair.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So Uncle Wiggily took the third little kitten
	home, and thus they were all found. And if the
	cat on our roof doesn&#8217;t jump down the chimney,
	and scare the lemon pie so it turns into an apple
	dumpling, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
	and the Jack horse.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE JACK HORSE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Well</span>, where are you going to-day, Uncle
	Wiggily?&#8221; asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy, the muskrat
	lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit
	gentleman putting on his tall silk hat, and taking
	his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
	crutch down off the mantel.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am going over to see Nannie and Billy
	Wagtail, the goat children,&#8221; answered the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;I have not seen them in a long while.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll be at school,&#8221; said Nurse Jane.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait until they come home, then,&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;And while I&#8217;m waiting I&#8217;ll
	talk to Uncle Butter, the nice old gentleman
	goat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So off started Uncle Wiggily over the fields
	and through the woods.</p>

	<p>Pretty soon he came to the house where the
	family of Wagtail goats lived. They were given
	that name because they wagged their little short
	tails so very fast, sometimes up and down, and
	again sideways.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"></a>&#8220;Why, how do you do, Uncle Wiggily?&#8221;
	asked Mrs. Wagtail, as she opened the door for
	the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;Come and sit down.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I called to see
	Nannie and Billie. But I suppose they are at
	school.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, they are studying their lessons.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll come in then, and talk to Uncle
	Butter, for I suppose you are busy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I am, but not too busy to talk to you,
	Mr. Longears,&#8221; said the goat lady. &#8220;Uncle
	Butter is away, pasting up some circus posters
	on the billboard, and I wish he&#8217;d come back, for
	I want him to go to the store for me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I go?&#8221; asked Uncle Wiggily, politely.
	&#8220;I have nothing special to do, and I often
	go to the store for Nurse Jane. I&#8217;d like to go
	for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well, you may,&#8221; said Mrs. Wagtail.
	&#8220;I want for supper some papers off a tomato
	can, and a few more off a can of corn, and here
	is a basket to put them in. And you might bring
	a bit of brown paper, so I can make soup of it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, starting off
	with the basket on his paw. Goats, you know,
	like the papers that come off cans, as the papers
	have sweet paste on them. And they also like
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"></a>brown grocery paper itself, for it has straw in
	it, and goats like straw. Of course, goats eat
	other things besides paper, though.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily was going carefully along,
	for there was ice and snow on the ground, and
	it was slippery, and he did not want to fall. Soon
	he was at the paper store, where he bought what
	Mrs. Wagtail wanted.</p>

	<p>And on the way back to the goat lady&#8217;s house
	something happened to the old rabbit gentleman.
	As he stepped over a big icicle he put his foot
	down on a slippery snowball some little animal
	chap had left on the path, and, all of a sudden,
	bango! down went Uncle Wiggily, basket of
	paper, rheumatism crutch and all.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; cried the rabbit gentleman, &#8220;I fear
	something is broken,&#8221; for he heard a cracking
	sound as he fell.</p>

	<p>He looked at his paws and legs and felt of
	his big ears. They seemed all right. Then he
	looked at the basket of paper. That was
	crumpled up, but not broken, and the bunny
	uncle&#8217;s tall silk hat, while it had a few dents in,
	was not smashed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! It&#8217;s my rheumatism crutch,&#8221;
	cried Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;It&#8217;s broken in two,
	and how am I ever going to walk without it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"></a>this slippery day I don&#8217;t see. Oh, my goodness
	me sakes alive and some bang-bang tooth powder!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Carefully the rabbit gentleman arose, but as
	he had no red, white and blue striped crutch to
	lean on, he nearly fell again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d better stay sitting down,&#8221; thought
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Perhaps some one may come
	along, and I can ask them go get Nurse Jane
	to gnaw for me another rheumatism crutch out
	of a corn-stalk. I&#8217;ll wait here until help comes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily waited quite a while, but no
	one passed by.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It will soon be time for Billie and Nannie
	Wagtail to pass by on their way from school,&#8221;
	thought the bunny uncle. &#8220;I could send them
	for another crutch, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So he waited a little longer, and then, as no one
	came, he tried to walk with his broken crutch.
	But he could not. Then Uncle Wiggily cried:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Help! Help! Help!&#8221; but still no one
	came. &#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; said the rabbit gentleman,
	&#8220;if only Mother Goose would fly past, riding
	on the back of her gander, she might take me
	home.&#8221; He looked up, but Mother Goose was
	not sweeping cobwebs out of the sky that day,
	so he did not see her.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"></a>Then, all of a sudden, as the rabbit gentleman
	sat there, wondering how he was going to
	walk on the slippery ice and snow without his
	crutch to help him, he heard a jolly voice singing:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Ride a Jack horse to Banbury Cross,</p>
		<p>To see an old lady jump on a white horse.</p>
		<p>With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,</p>
		<p>She shall have music wherever she goes.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>And with that along through the woods came
	riding a nice, old lady on a rocking-horse. And
	on the side of the rocking-horse was painted in
	red ink the name:</p>

	<p class="centered">JACK</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, hello, Uncle Wiggily!&#8221; called the
	nice old lady, shaking her toes and making the
	bells jingle a pretty tune. &#8220;What is the matter
	with you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I am in such trouble,&#8221; replied the bunny
	uncle. &#8220;I fell down on a slippery snowball, and
	broke my crutch. Without it I cannot walk,
	and I want to take these papers to Mrs. Wagtail,
	the goat lady, to eat.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"></a>&#8220;Ha! If that is all your trouble I can soon
	fix matters!&#8221; cried the jolly old lady. &#8220;Here,
	get up beside me on my Jack horse, and I&#8217;ll ride
	you to Mrs. Wagtail&#8217;s, and then take you home
	to your hollow-stump bungalow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, will you? How kind!&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;Thank you! But have you the
	time?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lots of time,&#8221; laughed the old lady. &#8220;It
	doesn&#8217;t really matter when I get to Banbury
	Cross. Come on!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily got up on the back of the
	Jack horse, behind the old lady. She tinkled
	the rings on her fingers and jingled the bells on
	her toes, and so, of course, she&#8217;ll have music
	wherever she goes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just as the Mother Goose books says,&#8221; spoke
	the bunny uncle. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad you came
	along.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said the nice old lady. Then she
	took Uncle Wiggily to the Wagtail house,
	where he left the basket of papers, and next he
	rode on the Jack horse to his bungalow, and,
	after the bunny uncle had thanked the old lady,
	she, herself, rode on to Banbury Cross, to see
	another old lady jump on a white horse. And
	very nicely she did it too, let me tell you.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"></a>So everything came out all right, and in the
	next chapter, if the apple pie doesn&#8217;t turn a
	somersault and crack its crust so the juice runs
	out, I&#8217;ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the
	clock-mouse.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CLOCK-MOUSE</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
	gentleman, sat in an easy chair in his hollow-stump
	bungalow. He had just eaten a nice
	lunch, which Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
	muskrat lady housekeeper, had put on the table
	for him, and he was feeling a bit sleepy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you going out this afternoon?&#8221; asked
	Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she cleared away the
	dishes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hum! Ho! Well, I hardly know,&#8221; Uncle
	Wiggily answered, in a sleepy voice. &#8220;I may,
	after I have a little nap.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your new red, white and blue striped
	rheumatism crutch is ready for you,&#8221; went on
	Nurse Jane. &#8220;I gnawed it for you out of a fine
	large corn-stalk.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily had broken his other crutch,
	if you will kindly remember, when he slipped
	as he was coming back from the store, where
	he went for Mrs. Wagtail, the goat lady. And
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"></a>it was so slippery that the rabbit gentleman
	never would have gotten home, only he rode
	on a Jack horse with the lady, who had rings
	on her fingers and bells on her toes, as I told you
	in the story before this one.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you for making me a new crutch,
	Nurse Jane,&#8221; spoke the bunny uncle. &#8220;If I go
	out I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he went to sleep in his easy chair, but
	he was suddenly awakened by hearing the
	bungalow clock strike one. Then, as he sat up
	and rubbed his eyes with his paws, Uncle Wiggily
	heard a thumping noise on the hall floor
	and a little voice squeaked out:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ouch! I&#8217;ve hurt my leg! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My! I wonder what that can be? It
	seemed to come out of my clock,&#8221; spoke Mr.
	Longears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I did come out of your clock,&#8221; said some
	one.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You did? Who are you, if you please?&#8221;
	asked the bunny uncle, looking all around. &#8220;I
	can&#8217;t see you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m so small,&#8221; was the answer.
	&#8220;But here I am, right by the table. I
	can&#8217;t walk as my leg is hurt.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily looked, and saw a little mouse,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"></a>who was holding his left hind leg in his right
	front paw.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the bunny uncle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse,&#8221;
	was the answer. &#8220;And I am a clock-mouse.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A clock-mouse!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
	in surprise. &#8220;I never heard of such a
	thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you remember me? I&#8217;m in
	Mother Goose&#8217;s book. This is how it goes:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hickory Dickory Dock,</p>
		<p>The mouse ran up the clock.</p>
		<p>The clock struck one,</p>
		<p>And down he come,</p>
		<p>Hickory Dickory Dock!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, now I remember you,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;And so you are a clock-mouse.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I ran up your clock, and then when the
	clock struck one, down I had to come. But I
	ran down so fast that I tripped over the pendulum.
	The clock reached down its hands and
	tried to catch me, but it had no eyes in its face
	to see me, so I slipped, anyhow, and I hurt my
	leg.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry to hear that,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"></a>&#8220;Perhaps I can fix it for you. Nurse
	Jane, bring me some salve for Hickory Dickory
	Dock, the clock-mouse,&#8221; he called.</p>

	<p>The muskrat lady brought some salve, and,
	with a rag, Uncle Wiggily bound up the leg of
	the clock-mouse so it did not hurt so much.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll lend you a piece of my old crutch,
	so you can hobble along on it,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; spoke Hickory Dickory Dock,
	the clock-mouse. &#8220;You have been very kind
	to me, and some day, I hope, I may do you a
	favor. If I can I will.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said. Then
	Hickory Dickory Dock limped away, but in a
	few days he was better, and he could run up
	more clocks, and run down when they struck
	one.</p>

	<p>It was about a week after this that Uncle Wiggily
	went walking through the woods on his
	way to see Grandfather Goosey Gander. And
	just before he reached his friend&#8217;s house he met
	Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; she said, swinging
	her cobweb broom up and down, &#8220;I want to
	thank you for being so kind to Hickory Dickory
	Dock, the clock-mouse.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"></a>&#8220;It was a pleasure to be kind to him,&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;Is he all better now?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, he is all well again,&#8221; replied Mother
	Goose. &#8220;He is coming to run up and down
	your clock again soon.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to see him,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	Then he went to call on Grandpa Goosey,
	and he told about Hickory Dickory Dock, falling
	down from out the clock.</p>

	<p>On his way back to his hollow-stump bungalow,
	Uncle Wiggily took a short cut through
	the woods. And, as he was passing along, his
	paw slipped and he became all tangled up in a
	wild grape vine, which was like a lot of ropes, all
	twisted together into hard knots.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
	caught!&#8221; The more he tried to untangle himself
	the tighter he was held fast, until it seemed
	he would never get out.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;This
	is terrible. Will no one come to get me out?
	Help! Help! Will some one please help me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I will help you, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; answered
	a kind, little squeaking voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman,
	moving a piece of the grape vine away from his
	nose, so he could speak plainly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"></a>&#8220;I am Hickory Dickory Dock, the clock-mouse,&#8221;
	was the answer, &#8220;and with my sharp
	teeth I will gnaw the grape vine in many pieces
	so you will be free.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That will be very kind of you,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily, who was quite tired out with his struggles
	to get loose.</p>

	<p>So Hickory Dickory Dock, with his sharp
	teeth, gnawed the grape vine, and, in a little
	while, Uncle Wiggily was loose and all right
	again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the bunny uncle to the
	clock-mouse, as he hopped off, and Hickory
	Dickory Dock went with him, for his leg was
	all better now. &#8220;Thank you very much, nice
	little clock-mouse.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You did me a favor,&#8221; said Hickory Dickory
	Dock, &#8220;and now I have done you one, so we are
	even.&#8221; And that&#8217;s a good way to be in this
	world. So, if the ink bottle doesn&#8217;t turn pale
	when it sees the fountain pen jump in the goldfish
	bowl and swim I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle
	Wiggily and the late scholar.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LATE SCHOLAR</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Heigh-ho</span>!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily Longears,
	the nice rabbit gentleman, one morning,
	as he hopped from bed and went to the window
	of his hollow-stump bungalow to look out.
	&#8220;Heigh-ho! It will soon be Spring, I hope, for
	I am tired of Winter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he went down-stairs, where Nurse Jane
	Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
	had his breakfast ready on the table.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily ate some cabbage pancakes
	with carrot maple sugar sprinkled over them,
	and then as he wiped his whiskers on his red
	tongue, which he used for a napkin, and as he
	twinkled his pink nose to see if it was all right,
	Nurse Jane said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yesterday, Uncle Wiggily, you told me you
	would like me to make some lettuce cakes today;
	did you not?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily, sort of
	slow and solemn like. &#8220;But what is the matter,
	Nurse Jane? I hope you are not going to tell
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"></a>me that you cannot, or will not, make those lettuce
	cakes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll make them, all right enough,
	Wiggy,&#8221; the muskrat lady answered, &#8220;only I
	have no lettuce. You will have to go to the store
	for me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And right gladly will I go!&#8221; exclaimed the
	bunny uncle, speaking like some one in an old-fashioned
	story book. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get my automobile
	out and go at once.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily had not used his machine
	often that Winter, as there had been so much
	snow and ice. But now it was getting close to
	Spring and the weather was very nice. There
	was no snow in the woods and fields, though,
	of course, some might fall later.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It will do my auto good to have me ride in
	it,&#8221; said the bunny uncle. He blew some hot air
	in the bologna sausage tires, put some talcum
	powder on the steering-wheel so it would not
	catch cold, and then, having tickled the whizzicum-whazzicum
	with a goose feather, away
	he started for the lettuce store.</p>

	<p>It did not take him long to get there, and, having
	bought a nice head of the green stuff, the
	bunny uncle started back again for his hollow-stump
	bungalow.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"></a>&#8220;Nurse Jane will make some fine lettuce
	cakes, with clover ice cream cones on top,&#8221; he
	said to himself, as he hurried along in his automobile.</p>

	<p>He had not gone very far, and he was about
	halfway home, when from behind a bush he
	heard the sound of crying. Now, whenever
	Uncle Wiggily heard any one crying he knew
	some one was in trouble, and as he always tried
	to help those in trouble, he did it this time.
	Stopping his automobile, he called:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what is the matter? Perhaps
	I can help you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Out from behind the bush came a boy, a nice
	sort of boy, except that he was crying.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, are you Simple Simon?&#8221; asked Uncle
	Wiggily, &#8220;and are you crying because you cannot
	catch a whale in your mother&#8217;s water pail?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No; I am not Simple Simon,&#8221; was the answer
	of the boy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you cannot be Jack Horner, because
	you have no pie with you, and you&#8217;re not Little
	Boy Blue, because I see you wear a red necktie,&#8221;
	went on the bunny uncle. &#8220;Do you belong to
	Mother Goose at all?&#8221;</p>

	<div class="illo">
		<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"></a>
		<img src="images/fig160.jpg" width="500" height="716" alt="Uncle Wiggily and a boy are in a car." />
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"></a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the boy. &#8220;I do. You must
	have heard about me. I am Diller-a-Dollar, a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"></a>ten o&#8217;clock scholar, why do you come so soon?
	I used to come at ten o&#8217;clock, but now I&#8217;ll come
	at noon. Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Why, of course, I know you!&#8221; cried
	Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly voice, as he put some
	lollypop oil on the doodle-oodleum of his auto.
	&#8220;But, why are you crying?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m going to be late at school
	again,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;You see of late I have
	been late a good many mornings, but this morning
	I got up early, and was sure I would get
	there before noon.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And so you will, if you hurry,&#8221; Uncle Wiggily
	said, looking at his watch, that was a cousin
	to the clock, up which, and down which, ran
	Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
	anywhere near noon yet,&#8221; went on the rabbit
	gentleman. &#8220;You can almost get to school on
	time this morning.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I suppose I could,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and I
	got up early on purpose to do that. But now
	I have lost my way, and I don&#8217;t know where the
	school is. Oh, dear! Boo hoo! I&#8217;ll never get
	to school this week, I fear.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will!&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily,
	still more kindly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what to do.
	Hop up in the automobile here with me, and I&#8217;ll
	<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"></a>take you to the school. I know just where it is.
	Sammie and Susie Littletail, my rabbit friends,
	and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels,
	as well as Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the goats,
	go there. Hop in!&#8221;</p>

	<p>So Diller-a-Dollar, the late scholar, hopped in
	the auto, and he and Uncle Wiggily started off
	together.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not be late this morning,&#8221; said the
	bunny uncle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you there just about nine
	o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily meant to do it, and he
	might have, only for what happened. First a
	hungry dog bit a piece out of one of the bologna
	sausage tires on the auto wheels, and they had
	to go slower. Then a hungry cat took another
	piece and they had to go still more slowly.</p>

	<p>A little farther on the tinkerum-tankerum of
	the automobile, which drinks gasolene, grew
	thirsty and Uncle Wiggily had to give it a glass
	of lemonade. This took more time.</p>

	<p>And finally when the machine went over a
	bump the cork came out of the box of talcum
	powder and it flew in the face of Uncle Wiggily
	and the late scholar and they both sneezed
	so hard that the auto stopped.</p>

	<p>&#8220;See! I told you we&#8217;d never get to school,&#8221;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"></a>sadly said the boy. &#8220;Oh, dear! And I thought
	this time teacher would not laugh, and ask me
	why I came so soon, when I was really late.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; Uncle Wiggily said. &#8220;I did
	hope I could get you there on time. But wait a
	minute. Let me think. Ha! I have it! We
	are close to my bungalow. We&#8217;ll run there and
	get in my airship. That goes ever so much faster
	than my auto, and I&#8217;ll have you to school in no
	time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>No sooner said than done! In the airship the
	late scholar and Uncle Wiggily reached school
	just as the nine o&#8217;clock bell was ringing, and so
	Diller-a-Dollar was on time this time after all.
	And the teacher said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Diller-a-Dollar, my ten o&#8217;clock scholar,
	you may stand up in line. You used to come in
	very late, but now you come at nine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the late scholar was not late after all, thanks
	to Uncle Wiggily, and if the egg beater doesn&#8217;t
	go to sleep in the rice pudding, where it can&#8217;t
	get out to go sleigh-riding with the potato
	masher, I&#8217;ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
	and Baa-Baa, the black sheep.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND BAA-BAA BLACK SHEEP</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">My</span> goodness! But it&#8217;s cold to-day!&#8221; exclaimed
	Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit
	gentleman, as he came down to breakfast in
	his hollow-stump bungalow one morning. &#8220;It
	is very cold.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed it is,&#8221; said Nurse Jane Fuzzy
	Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she
	put the hot buttered cabbage cakes on the table.
	&#8220;If you go out you had better wear your fur
	coat.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I shall,&#8221; spoke the bunny uncle. &#8220;And I
	probably shall call on Mother Goose. She asked
	me to stop in the next time I went past.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Nurse Jane wanted to know.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Little Jack Horner hurt his thumb the
	last time he pulled a plum out of his Christmas
	pie, and Mother Goose wanted me to look at
	it, and see if she had better call in Dr. Possum.
	So I&#8217;ll stop and have a look.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"></a>&#8220;Well, give her my love,&#8221; said Nurse Jane,
	and Uncle Wiggily promised that he would.</p>

	<p>A little later he started off across the fields and
	through the woods to the place where Mother
	Goose lived, not far from his own hollow-stump
	bungalow. Uncle Wiggily had on his fur overcoat,
	for it was cold. It had been warm the day
	before, when he had taken Diller-a-Dollar, the
	ten o&#8217;clock scholar, to school, but now the
	weather had turned cold again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; called Mother Goose, when
	Uncle Wiggily had tapped with his paw on her
	door. &#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>

	<p>The bunny uncle went in, and looked at the
	thumb of Little Jack Horner, who was playing
	marbles with Little Boy Blue.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Does your thumb hurt you much, Jack?&#8221;
	asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sorry to say it does. I&#8217;m not going
	to pull any more plums out of Christmas pies.
	I&#8217;m going to eat cake instead,&#8221; said Jack Horner.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go get Dr. Possum for you,&#8221; offered
	Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I think that will be
	best,&#8221; he remarked to Mother Goose.</p>

	<p>Wrapped in his warm fur overcoat, Uncle
	Wiggily once more started off over the fields
	and through the woods. He had not gone very
	<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"></a>far before he heard a queer sort of crying noise,
	like:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Baa! Baa! Baa!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! That sounds like a little lost lamb,&#8221;
	said the bunny uncle, &#8220;only there are no little
	lambs out this time of year. I&#8217;ll take a look. It
	may be some one in trouble, whom I can help.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily looked around the corner of
	a stone fence, and there he saw a sheep shivering
	in the cold, for most of his warm, fleecy wool
	had been sheared off. Oh! how the sheep shivered
	in the cold.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter with you?&#8221; asked
	Uncle Wiggily, kindly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am c-c-c-c-cold,&#8221; said the sheep, shiveringly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What makes you cold?&#8221; the bunny uncle
	wanted to know.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because they cut off so much of my wool.
	You know how it is with me, for I am in the
	Mother Goose book. Listen!</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;Baa-baa, black sheep, have you any wool?</p>
		<p>Yes, sir; yes, sir; three bags full.</p>
		<p>One for the master, one for the man,</p>
		<p>And one for the little boy who lives in the lane.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"></a>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I answered when they asked
	me if I had any wool,&#8221; said Baa-baa.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And what did they do?&#8221; asked the bunny
	uncle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why they sheared off my fleece, three bags
	of it. I didn&#8217;t mind them taking the first bag
	full, for I had plenty and it was so warm I
	thought Spring was coming. And it doesn&#8217;t
	hurt to cut off my fleecy wool, any more than it
	hurts to cut a boy&#8217;s hair. And after they took
	the first bag full of wool for the master they took
	a second bag for the man. I didn&#8217;t mind that,
	either. But when they took the <span class="keep_together">third&#8212;&#8212;</span>&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then they really did take three?&#8221; asked
	Uncle Wiggily, in surprise.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, to be sure. Why it&#8217;s that way in
	the book of Mother Goose, you know, and they
	had to do just as the book says.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; agreed Uncle Wiggily, sadly
	like.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, after they took the third bag of wool
	off my back the weather grew colder, and I began
	to shiver. Oh! how cold I was; and how
	I shivered and shook. Of course if the master
	and the man, and the little boy who lives in the
	lane, had known I was going to shiver so, they
	would not have taken the last bag of wool.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"></a>Especially the little boy, as he is very kind to
	me.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But now it is done, and it will be a long
	while before my wool grows out again. And as
	long as it is cold weather I will shiver, I suppose,&#8221;
	said Baa-baa, the black sheep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, you shall not shiver!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How can you stop me?&#8221; asked the black
	sheep.</p>

	<p>&#8220;By wrapping my old fur coat around you,&#8221;
	said the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;I have two fur
	overcoats, a new one and an old one. I am wearing
	the new one. The old one is at my hollow-stump
	bungalow. You go there and tell Nurse
	Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy to give it to you. Tell her I
	said so. Or you can go there and wait for me,
	as I am going to get Dr. Possum to fix the thumb
	of Little Jack Horner, who sat in a corner, eating
	a Christmas pie.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are very kind,&#8221; said Baa-baa. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
	to your bungalow and wait there for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So he did, shaking and shivering all the way,
	but he soon became warm when he sat by Nurse
	Jane&#8217;s fire. And when Uncle Wiggily came
	back from having sent Dr. Possum to Little Jack
	Horner, the rabbit gentleman wrapped his old
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"></a>fur coat around Baa-baa, the black sheep, who
	was soon as warm as toast.</p>

	<p>And Baa-baa wore Uncle Wiggily&#8217;s old fur
	coat until warm weather came, when the sheep&#8217;s
	wool grew out long again. So everything was
	all right, you see.</p>

	<p>And now, having learned the lesson that if
	you cut your hair too short you may have to wear
	a fur cap to stop yourself from getting cold, we
	will wait for the next story, which, if the pencil
	box doesn&#8217;t jump into the ink well and get a pail
	of glue to make the lollypop stick fast to the
	roller-skates, will be about Uncle Wiggily and
	Polly Flinders.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND POLLY FLINDERS</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">There</span>!&#8221; cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
	the muskrat lady housekeeper, who took care of
	the hollow-stump bungalow for Uncle Wiggily
	Longears, the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;There, it is
	all finished at last!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all finished?&#8221; asked the bunny
	uncle, who was reading the paper in his easy
	chair near the fire, for the weather was still cold.
	&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mean you have finished living
	with me, Nurse Jane? For I would be very
	lonesome if you were to go away.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll not leave you, Wiggy,&#8221;
	she said. &#8220;What I meant was that I had finished
	making the new dress for Susie Littletail,
	the rabbit girl.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle. &#8220;A new
	dress for my little niece Susie. That&#8217;s fine! If
	you like, Nurse Jane, I&#8217;ll take it to her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; spoke the muskrat lady.
	&#8220;I have not time myself. Just be careful of it.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"></a>Don&#8217;t let the bad fox or the skillery-scalery alligator
	with humps on his ears bite holes in it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised Uncle Wiggily. So
	taking the dress, which Nurse Jane had sewed
	for Susie, over his paw, and with his tall silk
	hat over his ears, and carrying his red, white
	and blue striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch,
	off Uncle Wiggily started for the Littletail
	home.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Susie will surely like her dress,&#8221; thought the
	rabbit gentleman. &#8220;It has such pretty colors.&#8221;
	For it had, being pink and blue and red and yellow
	and purple and lavender and strawberry
	and lemon and Orange Mountain colors. There
	may have been other colors in it, but I can think
	of no more right away.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily was going along past Old
	Mother Hubbard&#8217;s house, and past the place
	where Mother Goose lived, when, coming to a
	place near a big tree, Uncle Wiggily saw another
	house. And from inside the house came
	a crying sound.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?&#8221;
	sobbed a voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, ha! More trouble!&#8221; cried Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;I seem to be finding lots of people in
	trouble lately. Well, now to see who this is!&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"></a>Going up to the house, and peering in a window,
	Uncle Wiggily saw a little girl sitting before
	a fireplace. And this little girl was crying.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; called Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly
	voice, as he opened the window. &#8220;What is the
	matter? Are you Little Bo Peep, and are you
	crying because you have lost your sheep?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; answered the little
	girl. &#8220;I am crying because I have spoiled my
	nice new dress, and when my mother comes
	home and finds it out she will whip me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle. &#8220;Your
	mother will never do that. But who are you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you know? I am little Polly
	Flinders, I sat among the cinders, warming my
	pretty little toes. &#8216;And her mother came and
	caught her, and she whipped her little daughter,
	for spoiling her nice new clothes.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it says in the Mother Goose
	book,&#8221; said Polly Flinders, &#8220;and, of course,
	that&#8217;s what will happen to me. Oh, dear! I
	don&#8217;t want to be whipped. And I didn&#8217;t really
	spoil quite all my nice new clothes. It&#8217;s only my
	dress, and some hot ashes got on that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, that isn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily.
	&#8220;It may be that I can clean it for you.&#8221;
	But when he looked at Polly&#8217;s dress he saw that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"></a>it could not be fixed, for, like Pussy Cat Mole&#8217;s
	best petticoat, Polly&#8217;s dress had been burned
	through with hot coals, so that it was full of
	holes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, that can&#8217;t be fixed, I&#8217;m sorry to say,&#8221;
	said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sobbed Polly Flinders, as she
	sat among the cinders. &#8220;What shall I do? I
	don&#8217;t want to be whipped by my mother.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you shall not be,&#8221; said the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;Not that I think she would whip you, but we
	will not give her a chance. See here, I have a
	new dress that I was taking to Susie Littletail.
	Nurse Jane can easily make my little rabbit niece
	another.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So you take this one, and give me your old
	one. And when your mother comes she will
	not see the holes in your dress. Only you must
	tell her what happened, or it would not be fair.
	Always tell mothers and fathers everything that
	happens to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; promised Polly Flinders.</p>

	<p>She soon took off her old dress and put on the
	new one intended for Susie, and it just fitted her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, how lovely!&#8221; cried Polly Flinders,
	looking at her toes.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"></a>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;you must
	sit no more among the cinders.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not,&#8221; Polly promised, and she went and
	sat down in front of the looking-glass, where
	she could look proudly at the new dress&#8212;not
	too proudly, you understand, but just proud
	enough.</p>

	<p>Polly thanked Uncle Wiggily, who took the
	old soiled and burned dress to Susie&#8217;s house.
	When the rabbit girl saw the bunny uncle coming
	she ran to meet him, crying:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh! did Nurse Jane send you with my new
	dress?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;but
	see what happened to it on the way,&#8221; and he
	showed Susie the burned holes and all.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; cried the little rabbit girl, sadly.
	&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; spoke Uncle Wiggily, kindly,
	and he told all that had happened. It was a sort
	of adventure, you see.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad you gave Polly my dress!&#8221;
	said Susie, clapping her paws.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nurse Jane shall make you another dress,&#8221;
	promised Uncle Wiggily, and the muskrat lady
	did. And when the mother of Polly Flinders
	came home she thought the new dress was just
	<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"></a>fine, and she did not whip her little daughter.
	In fact, she said she would not have done so
	anyhow. So that part of the Mother Goose book
	is wrong.</p>

	<p>And thus everything came out all right, and
	if the shaving brush doesn&#8217;t whitewash the
	blackboard, so the chalk can&#8217;t dance on it with
	the pencil sharpener, I&#8217;ll tell you next about
	Uncle Wiggily and the garden maid.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GARDEN MAID</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p>&#8220;<span class="first_word">Hey</span>, ho, hum!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle Wiggily
	Longears, the rabbit gentleman, as he stretched
	up his twinkling, pink nose, and reached his
	paws around his back to scratch an itchy place.
	&#8220;Ho, hum! I wonder what will happen to me
	to-day?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Are you going out again?&#8221; asked Nurse
	Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper.
	&#8220;It seems to me that you go out a great
	deal, Mr. Longears.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, yes; perhaps I do,&#8221; admitted the
	bunny uncle. &#8220;But more things happen to me
	when I go out than when I stay in the house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And do you like to have things happen to
	you?&#8221; asked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;When they are adventures I do,&#8221; answered
	the rabbit gentleman. &#8220;So here I go off for an
	adventure.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Off started the nice, old, bunny uncle, carrying
	his red, white and blue striped barber-pole
	rheumatism crutch&#8212;over his shoulder this time.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"></a>For his pain did not hurt him much, as the sun
	was shining, so he did not have to limp on the
	crutch, which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him
	out of a corn-stalk.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far toward
	the fields and woods before he heard Nurse Jane
	calling to him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, Wiggy! Wiggy, I say! Wait a moment!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, what is it?&#8221; asked the rabbit gentleman,
	turning around and looking over his
	shoulder. &#8220;Have I forgotten anything?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, it was I who forgot,&#8221; said the muskrat
	lady housekeeper. &#8220;I forgot to tell you to bring
	me a bottle of perfume. Mine is all gone.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll bring you some,&#8221; promised
	Mr. Longears. &#8220;It will give me something to
	do&#8212;to go to the perfume store. Perhaps an adventure
	may happen to me there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Once more he was on his way, and soon he
	reached the perfume store, kept by a nice buzzing
	bee lady, who gathered sweet smelling perfume,
	as well as honey, from the flowers in Summer
	and put it carefully away for the Winter.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Some perfume for Nurse Jane, eh?&#8221; said
	the bee lady, as the rabbit gentleman knocked
	on her hollow-tree house. &#8220;There you are,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"></a>Uncle Wiggily,&#8221; and she gave him a bottle of
	the nice scent made from a number of flowers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My! That smells lovely!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle
	Wiggily, as he pulled out the cork, and took a
	long sniff. &#8220;Nurse Jane will surely like that
	perfume!&#8221;</p>

	<p>With the sweet scented bottle in his paw, the
	rabbit gentleman started back toward his hollow-stump
	bungalow. He had not gone very
	far before he saw a nurse maid, out in the garden,
	back of a big house. There was a basket
	in front of the maid, with some clothes in it, and
	stretched across the garden was a line, with more
	clothes on it, flapping in the wind.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. &#8220;I wonder
	if that garden maid, hanging up the clothes,
	wouldn&#8217;t like to smell Nurse Jane&#8217;s perfume?
	Nurse Jane will not mind, and perhaps it will be
	doing that maid a kindness to let her smell something
	sweet, after she has been smelling washing-soap-suds
	all morning.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the bunny uncle, who was always doing
	kind things, hopped over to the garden maid,
	and politely asked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to smell this perfume?&#8221;
	and he held out the bottle he had bought of the
	bee lady.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"></a>The garden maid turned around, and said in
	a sad voice:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you, Uncle Wiggily. It is very kind
	of you, I&#8217;m sure, and I would like to smell your
	perfume. But I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the bunny uncle. &#8220;The
	cork is out of the bottle. See!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That may very well be,&#8221; went on the garden
	maid, &#8220;but the truth of the matter is that I cannot
	smell, because a blackbird has nipped off
	my nose.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily, in great surprise, looked, and,
	surely enough, a blackbird had nipped off the
	nose of the garden maid.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Bless my whiskers!&#8221; cried the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;What a thing for a blackbird to do&#8212;nip off
	your nose! Why did he do such an impolite
	thing as that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, he had to do it, because it&#8217;s that way
	in the Mother Goose book,&#8221; said the maid.
	&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? It goes this way:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;The King was in the parlor,</p>
		<p>Counting out his money,</p>
		<p>The Queen was in the kitchen,</p>
		<p>Eating bread and honey.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"></a>The maid was in the garden,</p>
		<p>Hanging out the clothes,</p>
		<p>Along came a blackbird</p>
		<p>And nipped off her nose.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it was,&#8221; said the garden
	maid.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I remember now,&#8221; spoke Uncle
	Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m the maid who was in the garden,
	hanging out the clothes,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and, as
	you can see, along came a blackbird and nipped
	off my nose. That is, you can&#8217;t see the blackbird,
	but you can see the place where my nose
	ought to be.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily, &#8220;I can.
	It&#8217;s too bad. That blackbird ought to have his
	feathers ruffled.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, he didn&#8217;t mean to be bad,&#8221; said the garden
	maid. &#8220;He had to do as it says in the book,
	and he had to nip off my nose. So that&#8217;s why I
	can&#8217;t smell Nurse Jane&#8217;s nice perfume.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then
	he said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just you wait here. I think I can fix it so
	you can smell as well as ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the bunny uncle hurried off through the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"></a>woods until he found Jimmie Caw-Caw, the big
	black crow boy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Jimmie,&#8221; said the bunny uncle, &#8220;will you
	fly off, find the blackbird, and ask him to give
	back the garden maid&#8217;s nose so she can smell
	perfume?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Jimmie Caw-Caw, very politely.
	&#8220;I certainly will!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Away he flew, and, after a while, in the deep,
	dark part of the woods he found the blackbird,
	sitting on a tree.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Please give me back the garden maid&#8217;s
	nose,&#8221; said Jimmie, politely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered the blackbird, also politely.
	&#8220;I only took it off in fun. Here it is
	back. I&#8217;m sorry I bothered the garden maid, but
	I had to, as it&#8217;s that way in the Mother Goose
	book.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Off to Uncle Wiggily flew Jimmie, the crow
	boy, with the young lady&#8217;s nose, and soon Dr.
	Possum had fastened it back on the garden
	maid&#8217;s face as good as ever.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now you can smell the perfume,&#8221; said
	Uncle Wiggily, and when he held up the bottle
	the maid said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, what a lovely smell!&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the bunny uncle left a little perfume in a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"></a>bottle for the garden maid, and then she went
	on hanging up the clothes, and she felt very
	happy because she had a nose. So you see how
	kind Uncle Wiggily and Jimmie were, and
	Nurse Jane, too, liked the perfume very much.</p>

	<p>So if the little girl&#8217;s roller-skates don&#8217;t run
	over the pussy&#8217;s tail and ruffle it all up so she
	can&#8217;t go to the moving picture party, I&#8217;ll tell
	you next of Uncle Wiggily and the King.</p>

	<h2><a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
	<span class="chapter_name">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE KING</span></h2>
	<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
	<p><span class="first_word">Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
	gentleman, was sitting in an easy chair in his
	hollow-stump bungalow, one day, looking out
	of the window at the blue sky, and he was feeling
	quite happy. And why should he not be happy?</p>

	<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his muskrat lady
	housekeeper, had just given him a nice breakfast
	of cabbage pancakes, with carrot maple
	sugar tied in a bow-knot in the middle, and
	Uncle Wiggily had eaten nine. Nine cakes, I
	mean, not nine bows.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the bunny uncle to himself,
	&#8220;I think I shall go out and take a walk. Perhaps
	I may have an adventure. Do you want
	any perfume, or anything like that from the
	store?&#8221; asked Mr. Longears of Miss Fuzzy
	Wuzzy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, thank you, I think not,&#8221; answered the
	muskrat lady. &#8220;Just bring yourself home, and
	that will be all.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"></a>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do that all right,&#8221; promised the
	bunny gentleman. So away he hopped, over the
	fields and through the woods, humming to himself
	a little song which went something like this:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling happy now and gay,</p>
		<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t I, this lovely day?</p>
		<p>&#8217;Tis time enough to be quite sad,</p>
		<p>When wind and rain make weather bad.</p>
		<p>But, even then, one ought to try</p>
		<p>To think that soon it will be dry.</p>
		<p>So then, no matter what the weather,</p>
		<p>Smile, as though tickled by a feather.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily felt happier than ever when he had sung this song,
		but, as he went along a
	little further, he came, all at once, to a very nice
	house indeed, out of which floated the sound of
	a sad voice.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily was surprised to hear this, for
	the house was such a nice one that it seemed no
	one ought to be unhappy who lived there.</p>

	<p>The house was made of gold and silver, with
	diamond windows, and the chimney was made
	of a red ruby stone, which, as every one knows,
	is very expensive. But with all that the sad
	<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"></a>voice came sailing out of one of the opened diamond
	windows, and the voice said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! It&#8217;s gone! I can&#8217;t find it! I
	dropped it and it rolled down a crack in the
	floor. Now I&#8217;ll never get it again. Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, that sounds like some one in trouble,&#8221;
	said the bunny uncle. &#8220;I must see if I cannot
	help them,&#8221; for Uncle Wiggily helped real folk,
	who lived in fine houses, as well as woodland
	animals, who lived in hollow trees.</p>

	<p>Uncle Wiggily hopped up to the open diamond
	window of the gold and silver house, with
	the red ruby chimney, and, poking his nose inside,
	the rabbit gentleman asked:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Is there some one here in trouble whom I
	may have the pleasure of helping?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered a voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m here, and
	I&#8217;m surely in trouble.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who are you, and what is the trouble, if I
	may ask?&#8221; politely went on Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am the king,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;This is
	my palace, but, with all that, I am in trouble.
	Come in.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In hopped Uncle Wiggily, and there, surely
	enough, was the king, but he was in the kitchen,
	down on his hands and knees, looking with one
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186"></a>eye through a crack in the floor, which is something
	kings hardly ever do.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s down there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t get
	it. I&#8217;m too fat to go through the crack.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s down there?&#8221; Uncle Wiggily
	wanted to know.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My money,&#8221; answered the king. &#8220;You
	may have heard about me,&#8221; and he recited this
	little verse:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;The king was in the kitchen,</p>
		<p>Counting out his money;</p>
		<p>The queen was in the parlor,</p>
		<p>Eating bread and honey;</p>
		<p>The maid was in the garden,</p>
		<p>Hanging out the clothes,</p>
		<p>Along came a blackbird,</p>
		<p>Who nipped off her nose.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The fat man got up off the kitchen floor.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the king,&#8221; he said, taking up his gold
	and diamond crown from a kitchen chair, where
	he had put it as he kneeled down, so it would not
	fall off and be dented. &#8220;From Mother Goose,
	you know; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I dare say you&#8217;ll find the queen in the parlor
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"></a>eating bread and honey,&#8221; went on the king.
	&#8220;At least I saw her start for there with a plate,
	knife and fork as I was coming here. And, no
	doubt, the maid is in the garden, where she&#8217;ll
	pretty soon have her nose nipped off by a blackbird.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That part happened yesterday,&#8221; said Uncle
	Wiggily. &#8220;I was there just after it happened,
	and I got Jimmie Caw-Caw, the crow boy, to
	fly after the blackbird and bring back the maid&#8217;s
	nose. She is as well as ever now and can smell
	all kinds of perfume.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried the fat king. &#8220;You were
	very kind to help her. I only wish you could
	help me. But I don&#8217;t see how you can. My
	money, which I was counting, fell out of my
	hands and dropped down a crack in the floor. I
	can see it lying down there in the dirt, but I can&#8217;t
	get at it unless I move to one side my gold and
	silver palace, and I don&#8217;t want to do that. I
	don&#8217;t suppose you can move a palace, can you?&#8221;
	And he looked askingly at Uncle Wiggily.</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the bunny uncle.
	&#8220;But still I think I can get your money without
	moving the palace.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked the king.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why, I can go outside,&#8221; said Mr. Longears,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"></a>&#8220;and with my strong paws, which are just
	made for digging, I can burrow, or dig, a
	place through the dirt under your palace-house,
	crawl in and get what you dropped.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, please do!&#8221; cried the king.</p>

	<p>So Uncle Wiggily did.</p>

	<p>Down under the cellar wall of the palace,
	through the dirt, dug the bunny gentleman,
	with his strong paws. Pretty soon he was
	right under the kitchen, and there, just where
	they had dropped through the crack, were the
	king&#8217;s gold and silver pennies and other
	pieces of money. Uncle Wiggily picked them
	up, put them in his pocket and crawled out
	again.</p>

	<p>&#8220;There you are, king,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have
	your money back.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you ever so much!&#8221; cried the
	king. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have the cook give you some carrots.&#8221;
	And he did, before he went on counting
	his money in the kitchen. And this time
	he stuffed a dish-rag in the crack so no more
	pennies would fall through.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, Uncle Wiggily, where are you going
	now?&#8221; asked the King, as he saw the bunny
	gentleman hopping away with the bunch of
	carrots.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hardly know that myself,&#8221; answered the
	rabbit. &#8220;I want to have more adventures,
	either with the friends of Old Mother Hubbard
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"></a>and Mother Goose, or with some of the
	animal or birds that live in the woods.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think some adventures with birds would
	be exciting,&#8221; spoke the King. &#8220;This blackbird
	who nipped off the maid&#8217;s nose was a
	lively sort of chap.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He was, indeed,&#8221; agreed the bunny gentleman.
	&#8220;I think I should like some adventures
	with my feathered friends who fly in the air.
	When I come back I&#8217;ll tell you about them,
	Mr. King.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; begged the gentleman with
	the gold and diamond crown. And so, as long
	as the rabbit wishes it, and if the condensed
	milk doesn&#8217;t jump out of the molasses jug and
	scare the coffee pot so that it drinks tea, I
	shall make the next book &#8220;Uncle Wiggily and
	the Birds,&#8221; and I hope you will like it.</p>
